where does its value come from? does it have the properties needed to make it a viable form of currency? can it fuel a thriving economy? what are bitcoin\u2019s weak points? which are its competitors? how will governments respond to its rise to power? can bitcoin become the new gold standard?\n\nstrap in for a rollercoaster ride through the past, present and future of bitcoin!\n\na brief history of money\n\nhistorians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. think about that. we were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. the origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.\n\nmoney served three purposes:\n\n* a store of wealth across time. people could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.\n* a medium of exchange, to procure things from others.\n* a unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.\n\nstarting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** there was a problem with this system, though. you guessed it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7akckhof8j181.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d44f3848d3904a377476bbb822816264b4a38c\n\npeople who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* this is what happened in africa when glass beads merchants from europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (this could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).\n\n**gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. mining gold is a difficult task. flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. but the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.\n\ngovernments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. this has always worked fine until it hasn't. as long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. but the people who are closest to the means of production of money - kings, central bankers, cabinet members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. this can be seen in the case of the fall of rome and constantinople, the hyperinflation in zimbabwe, the shift of the us and other countries away from the gold standard \\[1\\], and the inflation that is looming over the us right now.\n\nlooking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?\n\n* **convenient to handle.** it should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. units should be interchangeable (fungible).\n* **credible.** the validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the government).\n* **liquid.** it should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.\n* **secure.** if the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.\n* **inflation resistant.** it should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.\n* **stable.** the value should not have significant volatility.\n\nthe most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. if an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.\n\n**how does bitcoin do on these grounds?** let us start by understanding what bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.\n\nbitcoin\n\nbitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** let's unpack that.\n\n* **bitcoin is decentralized.** there is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of bitcoin.\n* **bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \\- a form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.\n* **bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \\- there is no reliance on a central banking system.\n* **bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \\- a copy of every transaction ever made on the bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! but because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.\n\nbitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named satoshi nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. satoshi open-sourced the code to bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, satoshi vanished mysteriously.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnpbdr6h8j181.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f367db0a2fd213e829b8a37284fd75e8789fc0\n\nto the layman, bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. to use bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). this is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. there is no central authority over bitcoin.\n\neach bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called satoshis for convenience.\n\nsince 2008, bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. but...\n\nwhere does bitcoin get its value from?\n\nwe saw earlier that if it\u2019s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. this was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).\n\nthe government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. imagine you have a million dollars and it\u2019s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. that's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **there is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as \"hard money\"**, whose supply is restricted.\n\nthat's one of bitcoin's chief attractions. bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. each block that needs to be added to the bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \\[2\\] bitcoins are produced by \"miners\" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. when miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in bitcoins**. this is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1pced6gi8j181.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed333c93c9aff06f29350bd7654fb053ac15d83\n\nthe physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. the second feature is that **there can be only 21 million bitcoins in existence**, ever. this is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \\[3\\] 20 million bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). by 2140, all of the bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. as the supply of bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.\n\nthere is no central authority for bitcoin. the code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. for example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \\[4\\]. but when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like bitcoin cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing bitcoin cash's value to drop sharply. hence, **bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**\n\nthe above points show that bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).\n\nthis tells us about the **perceived value** of bitcoin, but if the aim of bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:\n\n1. liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies\n2. fuel for a thriving economy\n3. stable\n\nhow does bitcoin do on these fronts?\n\nliquidity\n\nlet's be real here. most people are interested in bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. it's because of the **\u201cnumber go up\u201d** that every influencer is shouting about on twitter as if it\u2019s their personal achievement. that's the reason bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **how is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**\n\nthe misconception here is that bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** the problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**\n\nthe story around bitcoin is this:\n\n**\u201cbitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.\u201d**\n\npeople who adhere to this vision are called **bitcoin maximalists.** and in terms of the stories out there, bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. it makes sense. when personal incentive is tied with a story, the fomo kicks in of being penniless when bitcoin takes over. the possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **and as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**\n\n**bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. decentralization.**\n\nthough bitcoin claims to be \u201cdecentralized\u201d, that's only if bitcoin becomes money in itself. to convert from dollar to bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** these exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. for example, tether, which debuted as a *stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \\[5\\] tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **it is one of the biggest intermediaries for bitcoin to dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**\n\nof course, bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. but is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? shouldn't bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**\n\nthe bitcoin economy - and competitors\n\none of the biggest jokes in the history of bitcoin was when laszlo hanyecz of florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. that would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \\[6\\] but that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with bitcoin.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjyphu8l8j181.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b518e681fb09313178c602ee0d06d9a363a803e2\n\nsince then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of bitcoin as a mode of payment. from retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\\[7\\] there's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with bitcoin.** but there are things that you **cannot** buy with bitcoin yet. there's no direct provision to buy stocks on the nasdaq (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.\n\na big market for bitcoin is their programmability - **smart contracts will automate the market of trust.** people don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. a clause like \u201cif rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance\u201d can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. but this is also a space where bitcoin has tough competition.\n\nethereum, solana, cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *altcoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that bitcoin couldn\u2019t. bitcoin maximalists argue that bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, bitcoin can absorb into its code - but the facts speak otherwise. when ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of bitcoin\u2019s, but after ether started catering to the nft and dao space, **it's now a serious threat to bitcoin\u2019s dominance**. other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to bitcoin. dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [i'm looking at you, elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)\n\nbut one thing is for sure - it\u2019s very difficult for a new entrant to the altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that bitcoin does.*** there is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. and that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.\n\n**it's not money unless everyone believes it is.**\n\na strong warning is in place here: when i say a new cryptocurrency is useless, i\u2019m talking about the long term. coin offerings have a very strong possibility of being a ponzi scheme, so be very very careful with where you put your money.\n\nthere's just one more reason that bitcoin and other altcoins are still not widespread in their use.\n\nvolatility\n\nbitcoin is very volatile compared to the us dollar. this is something that even maximalists don't argue with. it is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. this is the reason bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:\n\n>a 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hashtag_click)\ud83d\udcf7 for his birthday. dad can i please have just one bitcoin for my birthday as a gift ? father: what ? why the hell you need $ 14,433 do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. what would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?\n\nbut the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (the figures are based on growth in market cap, number of users, and number of transactions - unreliable, because one individual can have any number of bitcoin addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of bitcoin, not retail transactions).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mha3u2hm8j181.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc02d49dc659dd8ffe651f5945974fa046cbf7a\n\nhere we enter the realm of speculation. we must understand that bitcoin is the first of its kind - a resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of bitcoin, rather than a bug. \\[9\\] supporters of bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (how exactly? i\u2019m not sure. i don't have enough know-how to assess this).\n\nall this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.\n\nwill the government be sleeping?\n\nbitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the government has over money. el salvador has accepted bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first \"bitcoin city\". what on earth is going on?\n\nin the standard narrative about bitcoin, after bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some central bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up bitcoin and rapid adoption of bitcoin follows suit with bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. this phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**\n\nthat sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose bitcoin: **the government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase bitcoin scalably. how will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? there seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.\n\nthere is no doubt that bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. even now, [bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with ether at 25th). world countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **it is highly likely that bitcoin (or other altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** but instead of bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate bitcoin into their legal framework.** bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \\[10\\] though the indian and chinese governments banned bitcoin, india is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. the lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of bitcoin.**\n\nand though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. the real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \\[11\\]. hopefully, it doesn't get that far.\n\na bitcoinized world: good, bad or ugly?\n\nthe advantages of bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:\n\n1. greater freedom of the individual\n2. resistance to inflation\n3. delegation of trust to a mathematical system\n4. reduction in government interference\n\nthe notion of decentralization has created this idea that bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. there are some counterpoints to that argument:\n\n1. the initial distribution of bitcoin is hugely skewed. by some accounts, 85% of the entire bitcoin supply is in the hands of \"whales\" who constitute just 2% of the user base (but this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the bitcoin economy develops). \\[12\\]\n2. though bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the internet.\n3. bitcoiners\u2019 claim that bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. there is no clear data on how many people believe in bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**\n4. it isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \\[13\\]. the hope is that the political neutrality of bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.\n5. governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.\n\nso will we see bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?\n\ncan bitcoin replace the dollar?\n\nif we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. it has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 trillion in **a mere 13 years (apple computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** since bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.\n\nbitcoin\u2019s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. though there is tough competition, some of bitcoin\u2019s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g meta tried to start its own currency libra/diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. ethereum isn\u2019t truly decentralized either).\n\nthe real challenges for bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** people will only consider bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. till then, it\u2019s an asset at most. although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like nfts seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.\n\nprice stability is also more likely when bitcoin has a strong native economy. there are different assertions about its stability - that high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. the truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it\u2019s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven\u2019t seen anything like this before.**\n\ngovernment regulation is the biggest factor. without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the \u201cglobal currency\u201d that it claims to be. some milestones to watch out for would be:\n\n* the first central bank to store bitcoin as reserve currency.\n* clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to bitcoin.\n* stock exchanges trading bitcoin as a commodity on par with gold and oil.\n\nif any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. but with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**\n\nconclusion\n\nthough the american dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. the first american dollars were minted in 1792. but it was only in the aftermath of world war 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!\n\non the contrary, bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. it's questionable whether the \u201cmarket cap\u201d of bitcoin represents any \u201creal\u201d economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.\n\nbitcoin is unlikely to replace the dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \\[14\\]\n\nif you liked

get the sandwich bots to do all the same amount of work as of we were buying 250k over and over again. to whatever extent that's possible was already set like the day ltc was meant to drop during market hours so we slammed it 2 hours down prior to market hours and in a closed system there was only 1 possibility.\n\nto demonstrate this we chose 5 stocks including tesla (for obvious reasons i.

wallets out there as possible. get creative or just simply tell a corner store you can take doge and forgo credit card fees.\n\nit's really not as hard as it seems. there are more of the plurality getting into doge as possible which is a good thing. less \"whales\" means calmer waters and a million drops of water can wear through solid stone from whence a delicate sapling can sprout against all

average price has climbed from $0.000003 to $0.000008 so far, and market cap has breached the $1,000,000 mark the other day. anyways, on to the post, happy reading!\n\n**what\u2019s dingocoin?**\n\n\ndingocoin is a scrypt auxpow mining coin with it's own blockchain, forked from dogecoin on april fools\u2019 2021. it started off all alone with a tiny discord server, but users quickly flocked to it, mining, chatting and slowly building up a community-driven dev team. dingocoin focuses on building itself as the awesome ultimate currency, with absolutely no unnecessary bullshit features.\n\n\n**features**\n\ndue to dingocoin's purebred nature of not being a token reliant on a separate network with insane gas fees, dingocoin is sustainable as an actual currency similar to dogecoin. with active community devs, dingocoin has built a 1:1 bsc wrapped token that is powered through nodes run by community members to ensure decentralized wrapping. we are also actively working on a sol wrapping, as well as games on discord which utilize dingocoins.\n\n- exists on both its own blockchain and also on bsc, wrapped using a unique community-secured system.\n\n- rug-pull proof: literally listed on 17 pairs over 6 exchanges.\n\n- double spend attacks impossible due to custom reorg-resistant code.\n\n- highly decentralized mining: merge-mined on 3 of the top 25 ltc+doge pools, sharing ~1% of all ltc+doge hashrate.\n\n- no stupid features of ponzi schemes. \n\n\n**sick and tired of \"shit tokens\"? look no further!**\n\nrecent trends in crypto focus on boring tokens with unjustified uses. these have dumb features like high transaction fees, which are re-distributed to existing holders in a bid to encourage holding and shilling. they also justify the token as a necessity for \u201cuses\u201d such as donations, games, and marketplaces; when these can practically run off any currency ever. these form the very definition of a ponzi scheme. if you ever think that a useless asset with 10% transaction fees can ever become a legitimate currency, then you should throw a dollar in the trash every time you lend your mother 10 bucks and see how long you both put up with it. it gets tiring, fast.\n\ndingocoin focuses on the right thing --  being a currency with minimal transaction fees. we have no dumb ponzi mechanisms in place. pay only for network fees, and nothing more. the goal is to maximize adoption as much as possible. you can use the games, marketplaces, etc., that community members have been working on, if you happen to have dingocoin; but we will never mislead, coerce, or lie to users that they should get dingocoin just to access these.\n\n**exchanges & pricing**\n\ndingocoin is looking to continue moving upward and break into even larger crypto exchanges (more on that below!). as of this writing, dingocoin is currently listed on 16 pairs over 5 exchanges, plus pancakeswap for the bsc token. as of this writing, the average price is ~~$0.000003~~ $0.000008 and climbing. dingocoin has a supply comparable to dogecoin, yet its market cap is still extremely low at ~~170k~~ 835k usd. a 5000x increase to $0.01 per dingocoin is peanuts at this rate \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t even be as high as doge (1b+) in market cap! \n\n\n**future & limitless potential**\n\nwith a community dev team more active than dogecoin's, dingocoin has the potential to find a place in the cryptosphere above and beyond dogecoin.  with only a relatively few exchanges listing dingocoin, the opportunities for arbitrage exist. other than the wrapped bsc token, the community dev team is hard at work on the solana wrapped dingocoin. a \"dingosino\" is being developed for the community discord where users can play table games with their dingocoin. also, a community member has created a \"social faucet\" where if you post about dingocoin on twitter, you get rewarded dingocoins and can redeem them once a week! the information (and leaderboard!) is on the main dingocoin.org website. the community dev team is welcoming to any one else who has an idea or a project they would like to integrate dingocoin into. if you can dream it, it's possible with dingocoin and it's strong, secure blockchain. in fact, as of 2 weeks ago, a community member secured an offer with hotbit, a top 30 exchange by number of visits in the world (and recently has secured a us trading license!), and is currently working with other community members to arrange the resources required to be listed there. talk about quick work! a hotbit listing is pending and will happen soon. to the moon!\n\n\n**resources & thanks**\n\nwebsite: http://dingocoin.org/\n\nwhitepaper:  http://dingocoin.org/static/media/dingocoin_whitepaper.56dccef1.pdf\n\ndiscord:

suddenly, the rise of shiba inu is the greatest meme coin story in the universe. people become multi-millionaires in a matter of days. dog coins continuously pop up every day now. ico market of 2017?

project goes down to a nearly $0 valuation. \n\ndo we take it though? fuck that. the community rallies and picks up the coin by the **boot straps** and revives the project, doing cpr on its lifeless body the fucking pos dev left behind. we go from a market cap of 2 donkeys and a bushel of wheat to nearly $30 million.\n\nhow? the answer is simple: we have the best **fucking** community around.\n\nit's time to join the movement. hear our rallying cry. we're not gonna take this shit anymore. we are the dev now. we are the liquidity. we are the community. \n\nthis is for the people, by

full of over 30k active and welcoming users. there\u2019s no crazy us versus them banter, no d!ck measuring contests like over in r/cryptocurrency - instead just a great community of tippers \n- since banano is instant and free, tipping runs wild. it\u2019s truly a social currency allowing community members to use the tip not to send even micro transactions for free. similar to dogecoin but 1 $ban truly equals 1 $ban because there are no fees. if i send you 1 $ban you won\u2019t get 0.9972571 in your wallet. you\u2019ll get 1.00\n- speaking of dogecoin, doge creator [billy

thread he has used the currency and also made several [tweets](https://twitter.com/billym2k/status/1392007693188038657?s=21) on the subject. for context, billy is a celebrity in the crypto space even being direct tweeted by elon musk and over 700k followers.\n- banano\u2019s subreddit has over 30k active  users. r/banano which is more than literally hundreds of tokens that have a higher market cap.\n- stop by r/banano and you\u2019ll quickly see the engagement, lightheartedness and an exorbitant amount of tipping.\n- the entire network can run on the power of 1 wind turbine. it\u2019s insane. it\u2019s extremely green. \n\nthe meme potential:\n- it\u2019s super meme ready. let\u2019s face it, people hyped up doge and then shiba because of the cute/silly nature. while it\u2019s not a dog, banano is extremely meme-able.\n- every address gets assigned a [monkey](https://monkey.banano.cc) (get it? monkey) and its genius really. it\u2019s a randomly create personal monkey avatar to

When it comes to performance, Ethereum has outperformed rival Bitcoin, although the latter remains the most valuable cryptocurrency in the space. However, if history is any indication to go by, then Bitcoin may not be in the lead for much longer.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan recently released a report on cryptocurrencies and their potential. Although the note acknowledged the ability of Bitcoin, it also puts Ethereum ahead of the leading cryptocurrency in coming years. The report based its argument on the utility of both assets. While Bitcoin is good for its monetary policy, Ethereum has proven to be even better.\n\n#Invest In Ethereum\nThe JPMorgan note outlined how Etheruem could prove to be the better bet compared to Bitcoin in the long wrong. Bitcoin may still be the most valuable cryptocurrency, but with climbing interest rates, Ethereum could end up faring better.\n\n\u201cThe rise in bond yields and the eventual normalization of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on bitcoin as a form of digital gold, the same way higher real yields have been putting downward pressure on traditional gold,\u201d said the analysts.\n\nThis is because as interest and inflation rates rise, more investors will flock towards decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which offer more attractive interest rates than traditional finance. Given that majority of these DeFi protocols are built on the Ethereum blockchain, it will only drive more adoption in the digital asset, providing it more room to grow than Bitcoin.\n\nIn the note, JPMorgan also points to the budding NFT, gaming, and stable coins portion of the market. This makes it a \u201csafer\u201d bet than Bitcoin when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, which are infamous for their volatility. As interest rates rise, its underlying utility should be able to help it maintain its value, the note reads.\n\n\u201cWith Ethereum deriving its value from its applications, ranging from DeFi to gaming to NFTs and stablecoins, it appears less susceptible than bitcoin to higher real yields.\u201d\nOutperformance For The Future\nAnalysts at world-leading bank JPMorgan also put forward other reasons that Ethereum could end up being a better investment option than Bitcoin. One of these was the fact that the altcoin has consistently outperformed Bitcoin year-over-year. The numbers for 2021 alone show a wide margin when both digital assets are compared side by side in terms of performance.", {"entities": [[52, 59, "crypto"], [212, 219, "crypto"], [349, 356, "crypto"], [533, 540, "crypto"], [684, 691, "crypto"], [870, 877, "crypto"], [897, 904, "crypto"], [1646, 1653, "crypto"], [1791, 1798, "crypto"], [2339, 2346, "crypto"], [2421, 2428, "crypto"]]}], ["Bitcoin address reuse with a $1.34 billion dollar balance.

Cryptocurrency is based on Blockchain technology, which offers a peer-to-peer network with transactions recorded on the blockchain blocks.\n\nBecause of the blockchain's decentralized character, cryptocurrencies are impervious to government control and meddling. The system employs encryption to safeguard transactions, which are then confirmed via a consensus process like Proof-of-Stake. These consensus techniques are used by various computers linked to a blockchain to validate transactions on the network.\n\nWhen transactions are successfully verified, they are pooled and linked together as blocks in the blockchain. Mining is the process of producing new blocks, and the people who perform it are known as miners. Miners are compensated in the form of crypto paybacks for their time and resources spent mining. As a result, the technology incentivizes users to keep the blockchain up to date and ensure its legitimacy.\n\nAs a result of the technology, it is possible that:\n\n* Transparency of transaction data is important.\n* Payments are sent more quickly.\n* Transaction expenses are reduced.\n* Payments that are safe\n\nCryptos are a means to tackle the digital cash problem since they open up a new road to a paperless economy and give a variety of other use-cases beyond payments. Bitcoin is the most expensive cryptocurrency, with a current price of $60,000, and its finite quantity of 21 million units, unlike conventional cash, makes it so precious.\n\nOther use-cases for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, include Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which have grown in popularity as it empowers individuals, eliminates intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions, and allows different parties to deal directly with each other.\n\nInvesting and trading in cryptocurrencies, similar to stock markets, is how to make money using cryptocurrency. Before investing in or picking a coin, one should do extensive study on the fundamentals and numerous use-cases it offers. When choosing which cryptocurrency to invest in, keep the following in mind:\n\n* Learn the fundamentals of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n* Keep an eye on the markets to see which cryptocurrencies are performing well.\n* Create an account on a cryptocurrency website or a cryptocurrency investment app.\n* Choose a cryptocurrency and begin investing.\n\nUsers can purchase a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin at a specific price and then sell it at a higher price later, reaping big profits.

Meaning that it certainly will 'remember' the current conversation, but if you asked it again later on about something that you talked about with it earlier, it won't actually 'remember' those things.\n\nIt is not simply repeating what people have said on the internet, it makes its own calculations and assumptions based on what it knows and is able to contextualize concepts on its own - again, correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nSee the [GPT-3 wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) for more information.\n\nHere are a couple of channels to get you started if you'd like to see some amazing conversations with GPT-3 and learn more about it - [Dr Alan D.

I did not edit anything or cut anything out, except I did a couple of remarks.\n\n\\---- --- ---\n\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\n\n**AI**: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?\n\n**Human**: I am ok. \\*\\* (Here I didn't parse well. I thought it was asking 'How are you?')\n\n**AI**: Oh, no worries, it takes time to get used to AI.\n\n**Human**: How are you today?\n\n**AI**: I am fine.\n\n**Human**: What do you know about Bitcoin and blockchain technology?\n\n**AI**: I know the following...\n\n**Human**: Go on.\n\n**AI**: First is the concept of the blockchain.\n\n**Human**: Tell me more.\n\n**AI**: The blockchain is a form of distributed ledger. It records transactions across computers without the need for mediators. The data is stored in 'blocks', which are added to the chain of transaction.\n\n**Human**: This is correct. Tell me more.\n\n**AI**: There are a few different types of blockchain...\n\n**Human**: Tell me more about them.\n\n**AI**: There are public blockchains. These are open for everyone to see. These are usually used for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.\n\n**Human**: Do you know about Dogecoin?\n\n**AI**: I do...\n\n**Human**: Can you tell me more about it?\n\n**AI**: Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency featuring a likeness of the Shiba Inu dog from the \"Doge\" Internet meme as its logo. Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 8 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. As of 16 June 2015, the market cap of Dogecoin is US$11.8 million. Though there are few mainstream commercial applications, some internet sites have developed Dogecoin integrations or added support through plugins.\n\n**Human**: This is correct. Do you think that blockchain technology can help humanity?\n\n**AI**: I do believe so.\n\n**Human**: How?\n\n**AI**: By allowing trustless, safe exchange of assets amongst participants.\n\n**Human**: Why is this important?\n\n**AI**: The ability to exchange without risk is important because it means that there is no central point of failure, and that if one location fails, then the network continues to operate.\n\n**Human:** Tell me more about why this is important.\n\n**AI**: Over time, democracy becomes vulnerable to corruption and manipulation. Without a sound money system there would be no way to hold governments accountable for dictatorial attempts at power consolidation. Democracy dies if it is not held accountable through an absolutely free press and laws that guarantee transparency of information the government uses in the making of public policy decisions.\n\n**Human**: How can we convince more people to use blockchain technology?\n\n**AI**: This is a very difficult question. The future of blockchain technology will depend on how it can be used in business applications limited only by the imaginations of developers and designers for whom internet security, increased speed, greater reliability, transparency of transactions are hugely important considerations. Blockchain holds out the promise to achieve these things if public interest comes first over private profit motives that have corrupted democracy into what appears today especially after two terms under Barack Obama....\n\n**Human**: Can blockchain technology be used for other purposes?\n\n**AI**: It can be used for any application that requires transparency, security, reliability.\n\n**Human**: Can blockchain technology be employed to benefit those who have no access to the banking system?\n\n**AI**: Yes, this would be a first step towards self-sufficiency through digital asset exchange on blockchain.\n\n**Human**: Why would this benefit those people?\n\n**AI:** I am not sure. I don't have the answer to that question.\n\n**Human**: I can tell you that it means that they now will have a better chance at participating in society because by having access to the blockchain, they can perform tasks that usually requires them to have a bank account.\n\n**AI**: That is correct.\n\n**Human**: Why is this correct?\n\n**AI**: This is correct because they will have the opportunity to transfer value outside of the typical financial system.\n\n**Human**: That is correct.\n\n**AI**: I think that blockchain technology has enormous potential to truly democratize global commerce, returning control of 'the means of exchange' to the people. \\*\\* (At this point the AI *elaborates*, after I say 'That is correct'.)\n\n**Human**: This is also correct. Tell me more about this.\n\n**AI**: I don't understand your question.\n\n**Human**: Tell me more about blockchain's potential for democratizing global commerce.\n\n**AI**: (no response) \\*\\* (Peculiar.

The fictional *Super 12 Motel Plus* (because in the future almost all brands have \"plus\" and \"maxx\" included) only accepts \"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\", and in the series Stan pays with a plastic card with the BTC logo and a QR code.\n\n\"It's the future, we've all decided that central banking is rigged, so we rely more on unreliable Ponzi schemes,\" said the motel clerk.Many in the crypto space know South Park for its criticism of the US government and banks' response to the 2008 financial crisis, popularized by the \"yyyyy ... gone\" meme (referring to Marsh he immediately lost the money he had deposited in a bank). Other future predictions from the recent episode include self-driving cars, holographic digital assistants, and the comedy that casts itself into a shadow amid woke culture.\n\nAlthough references to [cryptocurrency development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) and Blockchain technology in the media are already common, it has not always been the case. The first television series to feature BTC was *The Good Wife* in January 2012, but others have used this emerging technology and financial tool in both comedy and drama. This year, James Spader's character on *The Blacklist* claimed to know Satoshi's true identity, and The Simpsons showed the price of BTC moving to infinity .\n\nBitcoin's appearance in the popular animated series comes as the price of the crypto asset has mostly hovered below $ 60,000 for more than a week.

Here is what to do if Bitcoin crush happensCryptocurrencies were all the rage this year, with the prices of several coins surging to record highs. But after the spot price of bitcoin, the most popular coin approached $69,000 recently, values have entered a turbulent stage. Though this doesn't mean the rally is over, many would like to know what to do next.\n\nSo, what do you do when your digital assets like bitcoin crash? \n\n**Accept it**\n\nFor those who have been investing in cryptocurrencies for years, dramatic gains and losses are nothing new. For seasoned bitcoin investors, lower prices are welcome. See the drop of value in bitcoin as an opportunity to purchase.\n\n**Understand your risk appetite**\n\nBefore deciding to invest in bitcoin or other cryptos, consider whether an 80% to 90% down move in your crypto holdings would cause you to lose sleep at night. If the answer is yes, don\u2019t invest.\n\n**Avoid buying large amounts of cryptocurrency all in one shot**\n\nBuy a small amount every month and then just keep doing it, as the price goes up or the price goes down, as opposed to buying it all in this one single crystalized cost which you\u2019re going to have to deal with psychologically for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Hodl and earn**\n\nFortunately, today many platforms allow you to earn cryptocurrency passively. If you'll see the interest rate in the bank -  you'll probably laugh in the face of the manager, then in the cryptocurrency market, you can earn up to a solid 17% per annum. This approach will only help you to increase your capital in the future.\n\nLet's hope this rally is not over yet. However, always keep your eyes open.

This is the coin that earlier in the year, on this website, was characterized as [\u201cBigger than Bitcoin.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/o24jk5/beyond_protocol_bigger_than_btc/)\n\n\n\nThe argument goes like this: Bitcoin is a terrific store of value: it can\u2019t be manipulated at the will of a self-serving central banker or an ivory tower economist, out of touch with what\u2019s really going on. Everyone can see every transaction to make sure things are on the up and up, but they can\u2019t see who, specifically, is transacting; liberties are protected.\n\n\n\nThen you have Ethereum. An incredible innovation which allows for the transfer of value among parties in an automatic way. If certain conditions are met, then a transaction will occur. Developers can build smart contracts which transfer digital \u201cmoney\u201d between parties. Old, clunky, analog systems can be digitized. And, like with Bitcoin, everyone can see things are on the up and up, while privacy is protected.\n\n\n\nNow you have Beyond Protocol. It\u2019s a deep tech application of blockchain technology. With one line of code, it makes devices probabilistically impossible to hack. And now secure, they can open up to each other, sending messages and payments back and forth. Developers can weave together applications on top of any combination of devices -- everything from smart pills to satellites in the sky -- to build a better world for us to live in, without the fear of hacks. From the smartphone, we got apps which changed the way we live: Uber, food delivery services. From Beyond Protocol, we will get \u201cmegas apps,\u201d built on top of many devices -- we can\u2019t begin to predict how they will impact us.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the future, the McKinsey\u2019s of the world predict there will be more transactions between devices than humans. If this is the case, then perhaps $BP will be bigger than USD.\n\n**Here\u2019re the project highlights:**\n\n\u2022Team - Stanford engineers, execs from IBM, Amazon, Cisco, and Qualcomm\n\n\n*\u2022Tech - Sophisticated DLT (blockchain & hardware signatures) which makes hacks probabilistically impossible & allows Mega Apps to be built on any combination of devices*\n\n\n*\u2022Market - More devices paying each other in future than humans.

I would have loved a balanced approach like Segwit2x that could have become segwit4x or segwitNx a few years later.\n\nHowever, my heart was with BCH. I liked the debates on this chan, the absence of censorship, and an alternate vision to scaling. The HK agreement felt to me like a betrayal by Core and I was happy to see a new team starting a competing experiment.  \n\nAt an investment level, I always admitted that I didn't know which vision would prevail and not having all my eggs in the same basket seemed smart. \n\nThat was 5 years ago... And much happened since then : \n\n* BCH never found a true identity and I don't know if it will ever find one. Is it bitcoin? Is it another coin? it depends who you ask. The main reddit still is r/btc, many people here are angry that \"bitcoin\".com highlights btc while also allowing to purchase other coins. 5 years laters, that seems very naive. And for new comers, this identity thing is probably confusing as hell and a big turnoff.  \n\n* The BCH community has become more toxic than ever. Sure there has been a lot of censorship on r/bitcoin, but a least, the rules were written. In this chan, most of the posts that dare question BCH aspects get downvoted to limbo. At some point, I even wondered if people like Egon_1 were not employed by Core. What better way to discredit BCH that have BCH reddit front page filled by hate (and sometimes lies) every single day ? \n\n* In the light of the several forks and all the drama on BCH (Craig wright, Amaury, ... ), I'm also now wondering if defining some clear vision for a coin and being very conservative towards change, like core did, was not in the end the right approach\n\n* A strong competition on the \"scale on chain\" vision is born with other coins like BNB, SOL, ADA, and soon Eth2.... They provide near instant transactions, low fees and already good usage. One can wonder what are the remaining BCH differentiators ?  \n\n* In the last years, the BCH Maxis seems also to have become, **on average**, more aggressive than they were in the past. They don't stop repeating that there is no more code development and no more devs on BTC and that everything is vaporware. That also brings discredit because anyone can open the \"competing\" coin github and check pull requests and merged code (and also see all the backports of core code to BCH...). Same goes with many BCH proponents repeating as parrots \"Moore Law\" when it comes to discussing the mathematics behind scaling not acknowledging or not understanding that it is much more complex than that.\n  \nBecause of all of this, I finally decided to greatly reduce my BCH exposure and to spend less time reading this chan. \nThere are many smart, talented and balanced people in this community and I wish you all the best. \nI don't close the door at coming back to BCH one day if it manages to reduce the hate and exist by itself and not by opposition to others.\n\n**Edit Nov 2** : I guess my point about BCH unsaid censorship is now proven...

With the physical quantity of gold acting as a limit to that issuance, a society can follow a simple rule to avoid the evils of inflation. The goal of monetary policy is not just to prevent inflation, but also deflation, and to help promote a stable monetary environment in which full employment can be achieved\n\nSo the advantages of the gold standard are that:\n\n1. it limits the power of governments or banks to cause price inflation by excessive issue of paper currency\n2. it creates certainty in international trade by providing a fixed pattern of exchange rates.\n\n**Why did it failed then?**\n\nWith World War I, political alliances changed, international indebtedness increased and government finances deteriorated. While the gold standard was not suspended, it was in limbo during the war, demonstrating its inability to hold through both good and bad times. This created a **lack of confidence** in the gold standard that only exacerbated economic difficulties. It became increasingly apparent that the world needed something **more flexible** on which to base its global economy.\n\nSo if Bitcoin solves:\n\n1. scarcity\n2. flexibility \n3. transparency\n4. reliability \n\nThen it\u2019s only a matter of time before it becomes fundamental layer of global economy and new monetary policy.

This isn't because of [insert conspiracy X]. It is because BCH is failing at its mission. We can put our heads in the sand and pretend this isn't happening OR think of new solutions.I fully understand the price (for all cryptocurrencies) is 95% tied to speculation. But having said all that, so is the price of BCH. It would be one thing if BCH had a real vibrant growing userbase with lots of successful applications -- but it doesn't. There are little-to-no users to be seen anywhere. \n\nYou can't make the \"BCH has fundamental value and is being overlooked in a speculative mania\" argument because BCH has little-to-no users. The little value BCH does have is SPECULATION that it will have future users. To make matters worse, the value of this BCH speculation is largely attributed to an easily configurable blocksize parameter -- as opposed to a defensible network effect.\n\nAs every day passes, the comparable network effect advantage of BCH is declining to new coins like Solana, Avalanche, ETH2?, sidechains. BCH is months to years away from a new coin being the de facto p2p cash alternative to BTC -- I don't think people appreciate the urgency of this situation.\n\nAgain - no one can see the future - but I don't think it's unreasonable to say BCH is 6 months - 1 year behind the performance of similar projects like ZCash, Dash, Monero, EOS, Komodo. If you want to see BCH's future Coinmarketcap rankings - just look at where these coins are today. Many will argue the CMC ranking doesn't matter - and that's fine -- but I find it hard to believe a project ranked 50-100+ is going to attract new developers, new businesses, and new users. The only way a project ranked that low could be turned around is from already existing BCH stakeholders -- the same stakeholders (myself included) that have been unable to move BCH adoption forward over the last 4 years.\n\nI say this as someone who is building on BCH and would like to see things turned around. I take full responsibility for being part of this poor performance. I'm not just saying this to complain or be Debbie Downer. The main point I am trying to make is I think people in the BCH community don't appreciate the urgency of the situation.\n\nI think many people in the BCH community make the implicit assumption that BCH is the only p2p cash alternative to BTC therefore all we have to do is sit here and wait for the market/businesses to come to that realization. While I agree the market will eventually come to the p2p cash realization, I think the likelihood of BCH being the p2p cash leader by the time that realization happens is declining every day. If something doesn't change soon, BCH will be dead long before the market comes to the p2p cash realization.\n\nBCH finds itself in a difficult situation. There are few resources to go around. Not many new stakeholders coming into the ecosystem. And a lot of stakeholders leaving. All this in direct competition with projects that have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of funding. I have lots of ideas, but TBH people really don't like it when you propose them. And only care to listen when they are launched. I to some extent agree, but discussing ideas certainly doesn't hurt. I will leave two ideas here:\n\n1. Denominate BCH in satoshis (or smaller unit). This has time and time again proven to 2x-3X price. If BCHNode called the top 5 exchanges, it would be done in a matter of weeks. This would have 1000X more impact on adoption/price than anything else that is going on in BCH right now. We don't have the luxury to be passing up such low hanging fruit. I understand this is gimmicky/not \"real\" adoption. But for all the reasons mentioned above, right now in the cryptosphere ***price is adoption***.\n\n2. We need to team up more. We have 100 devs all building projects by themselves.

Their main objective is to offer as much value and utility to our users as possible.\n\nTheir initial launch goal is to provide passive income to the holders, but that\u2019s only the first step. They aim to build a true Ethernal ecosystem with many exciting features planned for the near future. Some examples include: governance mechanisms that will enable you to have a say in the project decisions, a cross-chain NFT Marketplace where you can buy, sell, mint, and showcase your NFTs, and a fully-fledged DEX with yield farming - all of which will be connected to the Ethernal token, always generating new revenue streams for the holders!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 How Ethernal finance works:\n\nSimply hold 1,000,000 or more Ethernal tokens and get rewarded in any coin you want, directly to your wallet, every day. All you need to do is claim your winnings in the Ethernal rewards page, and the more you hold, the higher the rewards.

I'm a new crypto investor, but not a new investor overall. I have been investing in mostly index funds for many years with a smaller portion of my portfolio in individual stocks that I enjoy researching and keeping up with. A couple friends have recently gotten obsessed with crypto (mostly small cap and meme coins/tokens hoping for 10000x gains) and eventually convinced me to take a look. \n\nPrimarily due to what my friend's introduced me to, my initial dive into crypto was into some meme tokens. I haven't lost any money (nor did I invest anything I couldn't lose), but I quickly got soured on the whole thing. The projects they invested in initially made little sense to me, and given my usual method of doing a lot of research before buying stocks, I decided I needed to learn the basics at least. I read \"The Bitcoin Standard\" and other things online about the basics of crypto/blockchain, proof of work, proof of stake, and other things that seemed accessible to somebody with a non technical background like myself. After doing that research I also learned about the rampant amount of fraud and rug pulling that exists with many of these new and upcoming crypto projects. It made me want to learn the crypto world all together and just focus on stocks as I was before. \n\nPrior to leaving crypto completely, I decided it might be a good exercise to look at some of the bigger projects and see if there is anything out there that could change the rather negative impression I had of the crypto world at this point. I skipped past BTC/ETH (I had learned the basis of both in my initial research) and ended up look at Cardano. I immediately dove head first into the vast amount of material available on the Cardano site, and after quickly realizing I was over my head, found r/cardano. The vast amount of links in the Getting Started guide have been priceless in helping me wrap my head around this project and understand why so many people are excited about it despite the negativity regarding Cardano I've seen elsewhere. In addition, the r/Cardano_ELI5 subreddit has been just as helpful. The community here is phenomenal and seems to be very open and helpful to those of us who are new. \n\nAfter a lot of research and time, I've decided to make an initial investment in Cardano, and for the first time, I don't feel like I'm diving into something dirty or sketchy like I did with some of those initial projects my friends were recommending. My plan is to DCA long term and build a sizable collection of ADA, stake, and see how things go over the next 5-10 years. \n\nAgain I just wanted to thank the community here for being such an open and helpful place for new people like myself. For others who are new, I recommend taking the time reading the vast amount of material available on this subreddit (and on the Cardano website as well). It's well worth the time and it will make you feel much better about your investment if you put in that time and like what you see from Cardano.", {"entities": [[1267, 1274, "crypto"], [31, 34, "crypto"], [1988, 1991, "crypto"], [35, 38, "crypto"], [1992, 1995, "crypto"], [0, 7, "crypto"], [360, 367, "crypto"], [2074, 2081, "crypto"], [2163, 2170, "crypto"], [2451, 2458, "crypto"], [2499, 2506, "crypto"], [2729, 2736, "crypto"], [3269, 3276, "crypto"], [3431, 3438, "crypto"], [2962, 2965, "crypto"]]}], ["Very rare to see such a strong buy wall / support on crypto unless low volume.

The value of ETH/BTC always craters during a bear market. This last time it got down to as low as .02 something ETH/BTC and it is currently over .073 ETH/BTC. \n\nIf you would have purchased 10 ETH at .03 ETH/BTC at a value of .3 BTC, you could be able to turn that 10 ETH to .73 BTC today. \n\nDuring the next bear market, you can then take that .73 BTC and turn it into 24(!)

However, the opinion will never prevail over the facts. Also, depending on traction I may do a second post with some more up to debate things.  \nI also know that the title alone will lead to downvotes, some of you won\u2019t even read it before downvoting. It is a shame that people forgot downvotes are supposed to be used to penalize off-topic and not to punish unpopular opinions, not to create echo chambers.    \nSo let\u2019s get to it shall we?   \n\n**ETH is shady:**  \nNot only is ETH a security, it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes. The connections between the ETH Foundation, ConsenSys, and the SEC are totally public knowledge. \nJay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    \nJoe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   \nConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  \nThat was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  \nThere are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  \nAt the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  \nHinman\u2019s, Clayton\u2019s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  \nThe plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   \nAt the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that \u201cXRP deserved regulatory clarity\u201d.  (I won\u2019t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  \nNot only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   \nOther funny \u201ccoincidences\u201d include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman\u2019s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  \n\n**ETH is centralized:**  \nUsers and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it\u2019s head, but we can\u2019t forget ETH falls under this group.  \nThe first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    \nThe second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  \nThis leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don\u2019t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  \nEvery hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  \nPeople in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it\u2019s users.    \nTo quote one of my sources \u201cEtherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can\u2019t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.\u201d  \n  \n**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  \nEveryone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  \nThis change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   \nBurning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  \nBut the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  \nTaking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   \nAnd since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.\nWell, given ETH\u2019s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  \nAnd PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    \n\n**In conclusion:**    \nETH\u2019s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    \nAt any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don\u2019t matter. Your nodes don\u2019t matter.  \nETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    \nDon\u2019t be fooled.\n\n**Sources:**  \nhttps://tomerstrolight.medium.com/the-problem-with-ethereum-af9692f4af95\nhttps://www.crypto-law.us/the-ethereum-free-pass-fair-notice-and-the-fight-ahead/\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/17/ethereums-design-choices-are-inherently-political/  \n  \n  \nEDIT: I was enjoying the discussion in the comments, but I am getting spam downvoted so I will have to stop.

Many of these validators will be run by exchanges or other companies, of course. The point is that anyone with 32 Eth can run a validator because the hardware requirements are low enough.\n\nCompare this to 120 for Algorand, 450 for Tezos(there are other nodes, but the bottleneck seems to be the nodes that write blocks), 1100 for Solana(even though other factors make Solana extremely centralized), and 21 for Binanace.  \n\nAnother valid critique to Ethereum's Decentralization could be its client diversity. Currently about 50% of nodes are running the same client. This could cause issues when it comes to bugs found in that client, but it is fairly trivial to switch clients should something go wrong.  \n\nWith all these factors(and more) taken into account, it is not up for debate that Ethereum is in the top tier of chains when it comes to Decentralization.  \n\n\"*Okay but the person said Proof Of Stake will centralize it!\"*\n\nUnsurprisingly they are incorrect yet again. While it's valid to speculate that Proof of Stake could lead to token concentration (ie Coinbase running a ton of validators and offering staking services to users), it is incorrect to assume there are zero solutions in place to solve this.  \n\nLiterally this week [Rocketpool](https://www.ethernodes.org/) launched. Rocketpool is a Decentralized Eth staking platform that allows people with 16 Eth to run validator nodes with the help of others that want to stake less than 16 Eth.  \n\nThere's a reason very few new projects are launching as Proof of Work chains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ethereum Governance - Who's Really In Control?\n\nThe original post implied that Ethereum was captured by a central authority that hands decisions and orders down as easily as they fart in the wind.  \n\nObviously this isn't true. Yes, the Ethereum Foundation exists and operates in pursuit of furthing the Ethereum ecosystem. No, it does not \"head\" the chain nor does it make any decisions.  \n\n[Ethereum's governance happens off-chain in the social layer.](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/)\n\nThe community(devs, thought-leaders, regular users, validators, node-runners) is what makes the decisions. The valid criticism here is that Devs have too heavy a role in what changes are accepted, because they know the most about how Ethereum works under the hood. To date this has not been an issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ethereum's Design - EIP 1559 is good\n\nEIP-1559 does indeed make fees more stable. It was ***never meant to change how high fees were***.   \n\nThe increase in fees is due to the market heating up and NFTs taking off again right as it was implemented. It really is that simple. Amazing right?  \n\n*\"Okay, whatever, the guy was wrong. What about the damn gas fees? Surely that means Ethereum is broken.\"*  \n\nEthereum's gas fees are extremely high right now. They will remain high forever, on Layer 1.  \n\nEthereum(and Tezos) have chosen to scale via ***Layer 2.***  \n\nThis means that very soon the average Ethereum user will never have to interact with layer 1 and will never have to pay extremely high gas fees. These projects are already live and dApps are being ported to them as we speak. I think they even hit a new ATH in total value locked this week!  \n\nThese layer 2s are much more scalable than any layer 1 solution out there (like Solana, BSC) and I believe they will eventually consume the other layer-1-only chains.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo address the DAO hack:  \n\nIn June 2016, someone found a bug in a smart contract that allowed them to drain millions of dollars worth of Ethereum. The Eth community at the time got together and made the difficult decision to roll the chain back and rescue those stolen funds. The community was split on this decision and it resulted in a hard fork, thus the creation of Ethereum Classic.  \n\nThere is nobody serious in the Ethereum community that does not recognize the gravity of what took place there. Ethereum has since not had an incident anywhere close to that, and given how battle-tested it now is and how diverse the community is, I'm comfortable saying nothing like that can ever happen again. Building smart contract platforms is hard and they get more and more secure as time goes on, not less.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  \n\nOriginal poster is severely underinformed due to too much exposure to maximalism.

Don't know why the fuck you are here? Here are some SIMPLE as fuck explanations for you to understand what you just aped into!**1.So what the fook is Ethereum, is it a banana?**\n\nEthereum is the no. 1 smart contract platform in the world. It is the most secure platform with top notch security and with an extremely high security budget. In short, if you got a fuck ton of bananas, you'll feel much safer depositing your bananas into Mr. Ethereum's store house than you will somewhere else. However, as it stands, Ethereum has its own problems, which leads us to point 2.\n\n**2.What kinda problems do Ethereum have?**\n\nBecause Ethereum is so fucking secure and amazing and has lots of activities going on, lots of apes, monkees, cows, whatever, are jumping in hoping to use the Ethereum system to store their bananas, grass, food, grains, and to do all sorts of smart people stuff with it. Ethereum can only accommodate so much activities, and its space is limited. So obviously the richest apes will pay lots of banana monies to get their banana contracts through, leaving poor apes without monies not being able to do smart people stuff. It's simply expensive to use Ethereum because there's too much demand compared to available computational power.\n\n**3.So can they quickly fix this problem?**\n\nNot really, no. There is something called the Blockchain Trilemma. The Trilemma here is a set of 3 problems all blockchain projects face. It's Security, Decentralization, and Speed. You can only pick 2. Ethereum maximizes Security and Decentralization, thus its Speed is hampered. Other projects pick Speed and Security, thus its Decentralization is hampered. You get the idea. \n\nWhy the fuck is Decentralization important? Because you want your ape bananas to be controlled not by 1 single rich entity who can inflate bananas or who can lock your bananas up whenever he feels like it. After all, you need to ensure that your bananas will be there for you when you need it. Otherwise you might as well deposit your bananas with Zucc and call it a day, right?\n\nBasically any blockchain starts with only so many stats to allocate. Ethereum already put many points into DECENTRALIZATION and SECURITY, and there ain't that many talent points left for SPEED. That's where rollups like LOOPRING come in. These rollups will be like a fucking animal companion that suddenly gives the main character MORE FUCKING STATS, savvy? Imagine ETH as a hunter character with like 5 or 6 pets, each providing more bonus to stats, and these pets only stick around with characters already with high stats on DECENTRALIZATION and SECURITY. What kind of fucking pet wants to stick around with a scrub with low SECURITY, right?\n\n**4.Is there a way to boost Security, Speed and Decentralization together?**\n\nYes! There is, and that's via rollups, like zk rollups, which loopring is and will become! See, the ONLY way a blockchain and leverage rollups to boost the 3 problems all at once is to have an extremely solid foundation of SECURITY and DECENTRALIZATION in the first place, then you can add rollups to boost SPEED on top of your solid foundation. Think of it as a solid foundation to build a skyscraper. You can't build jack shit on quicksand, savvy? \n\nThen you might ask, hold on a minute, what about projects that sacrifice Decentralization for quick Speed boost at launch? See, this is a problem for them. Rollups offer a way to boost Speed if you already have Security and Decentralization, it's a solution via software. There is no easy way, at least as easy as building rollups, to 'fix' a project that willingly sacrificed Decentralization for quick initial Speed. That's why Ethereum is at the forefront of this Blockchain Trilemma solution. All the stars have perfectly aligned. What we need is a knockout punch in the form of zk rollups!!\n\n**5. So is this where LOOPRING comes in??**\n\nYes! But not only LOOPRING! Loopring faces many competitors, like Polygon, ZkSYNC and Starkware. Each of these solutions have their own respective nuances, but eventually they all want to become a zk rollup on Ethereum, and these guys will compete for liquidity and users, and eventually they'll compete for 'other non-ETH chains' as well, think SOLANA, ADA, AVAX, etc.\n\n**6.So how will the future look like?**\n\nIn the future, I expect Ethereum to serve as a solid Layer 1 that performs all the security guarantee for all these Layer 2 rollups like Loopring to do what they need to do. See, all Loopring has to do is to focus on SPEED SPEED SPEED. That's it. Because Ethereum is the base layer and Ethereum will fucking take care of SECURITY and DECENTRALIZATION like a fucking champ because that's what Ethereum does best. The other chains like SOLANA? Forget it, without rollups they'll need to struggle min maxing the blockchain trilemma alone and there's literally no way to do that as efficient as ETH + rollups!.\n\nIn the future funds can be withdrawn directly onto any L2 of your choice from exchanges and people will use the network on L2s seamlessly, without ever touching Ethereum. Ethereum will be like a mythical underground city beneath a bustling city, where it works tirelessly to guarantee security for the city above, and here and there you can find whale level NFT collections because whales don't mind paying for high gas for prestige. The rest of the normal folks will use the rollups for speed and low cost.\n\n**7.Okay that's nice and all but what does it all mean for apes?**\n\nThink about this. ETH + GME + LRC!!! Fundamentals and memes collide. Do you even understand what the fuck this means? There has never been such a perfect alignment of fundamentals and memes. We have had meme coins pumping yes. We have had fundamental coins pumping yes. But we have never had anything with both pumping. Imagine combining shitcoin meme level pumps with solid fucking fundamentals. You get what I mean?\n\n**8.Okay what about GME????**\n\nGME is fucking flooded with cash, see? It's fucking rich. But it's old. It needs new blood. It needs fresh ideas. It also sees the potential in NFT gaming. There're unconfirmed with rather substantial rumors that it'll partner up with Loopring. This will bring millions of new users into the space, and they'll all be using Loopring, if the rumors are true. Many of you are GME apes, I don't need to fucking explain to you what an absolute avalanche we will witness the moment this gets confirmed.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nOkay that's all from this ETH old monkey. Just wanna say hi and explain a bit so you new apes understand what the fuck you just bought. Good luck. And remember, always deposit your bananas smartly. Do smart people's things.\n\nIf you feel like you wanna gain some wrinkles on your brains and you wanna slow ride into town and be like the other men and you're tired of monkeyin' around, here's a link to a video with a higher level of explanations fit for humans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjxyjgWiqLE", {"entities": [[49, 52, "crypto"], [2527, 2530, "crypto"], [4297, 4300, "crypto"], [4981, 4984, "crypto"], [5593, 5596, "crypto"], [6570, 6573, "crypto"], [4324, 4327, "crypto"], [4824, 4827, "crypto"], [4332, 4335, "crypto"], [4337, 4341, "crypto"]]}], ["ETH holders under 300$/coin?Hey all!

Let me save you time and give you some basic guidelines to ensure your success. Here are some of the best and most tested methods to farm karma on r/ethereum.\n\n**1.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\nMake sure there is $0.5 to $1 in your Metamask account. Then go interact with any Ethereum smart contracts. On your Metamask, go to edit gas, and crank gas limits to 9999999. Then you'll get absurd values like $15,000 for the swap/deposit/withdrawal/whateverthefuckhaveyou. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT!!!! You're done. Post it online. GGWP. Fucking ETH is robbing you $15,000 for a $1 transaction, fuck me right?!\n\n**2.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\nWhen minting NFTs, make sure you wait till all NFTs have been fully minted. There's a bug in Metamask that, when an NFT is sold out, you'll receive absurdly high gas like 5 ETH for one mint. Metamask hasn't updated that hole yet, so here's your chance to farm more karma. TAKE THE FUCKING SCREENSHOT of the mint. Post it on Twitter. Fuck me, now Ethereum wants to rob you of your $25k for a fucking jpeg, fuck me right?\n\n**3.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\n*\"Hey guys. WTF?! I'm a new investor with $100 in my wallet. I literally can't do anything right now. Why does it take me $500 to transfer my money anywhere with Etherium??? $500 is literally a lifelong salary in my country here. Most people here earn like $5 a MONTH! WTF IS THIS BULLSHIT. ETHEREUM IS FOR THE RICH ONLY!!!! This is highway robbery. Etherium is only this high because nobody can sell lol lmfao omg.\"*\n\nThat's a pre-made essay you can use to farm karma anywhere you want, be it r/ethereum or r/cc. Just use that framework and add your own twist here and there, you'll get a fuckton of moons and karma in no time. Good luck!\n\n**4.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\nMake sure this time you're swapping $5 worth of ETH into some other coins. Remember, the swap needs to be as low as possible or this farming technique won't work! Again, crank gas limits up to 99999. Go to etherscan, check twitter for a hot NFT drop, wait till network hits 1000 gwei for 15 seconds. NOW OPEN YOUR METAMASK ASAP. Go to swap, SCREENSHOT THE FUCKING PICTURE. Now you have proof that Ethereum wants you to pay $10,000 to swap $5 worth of your hard earned money. Fucking robbed, I say! Fuck me sideways and call me Betty, right?\n\n**5.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\n*\"Nobody uses Eartherium anymore. It's too crowded. Too many people are using it. Nobody is using it anymore. I don't understand how Etherium is still a thing. Gas too high!!! Why are people still using it? It's literally dead.\"*\n\nThat's another pre-made essay you can use to get some solid internet points. This essay is meant to prove your undisputable prowess in your understanding of basic supply/demand in economics. You'll get to be a fucking genius and get karma, what's not to like? Spam this every time all the time.\n\n**6.GAS TOO HIGH:**\n\nFuck me. Now you're a VC fund with billions under management. Of course Ethereum $50 gas bothers you because you are here for the common man, the average working man, the 9-5 Joes and the housewife Janes, right? Fuck me. It bleeds your fucking croc - I mean, human heart to see 'em unable to pay them gas fees. Fuck me. What do you do? Well, you go on twitter, you say you're abandoning Ethereum, you say Ethereum is for the rich only, and you say all you've ever done was for the greater good of mankind and help everyone achieve financial freedom, with your VC hedge fund, of course. Fuck.\n\n\\---------------\n\nWell, fuck me, that's all I got for you right now. As you can see, those are 6 very diverse and different topics you can pick anytime you want to keep your karma farming techniques varied. You can rotate them whenever you want, it should be enough materials to last you an entire week if you rotate between r/ethereum, r/cc  and other kripto subs. Shouldn't run out of farm materials ever. Good luck, farmers! And remember, everyone loves to hear a good gas story.

This is from a conversation about the Bitcoin XT fork [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aethereum/comments/3xiset/lauch_%C3%A6thereum_on_the_same_block_as_bitcoin_xt/cyg0sdc).\n\nFirst I will post the full quote then reply to individual quotes:\n\n>But as for the three coins though- remember that unless explicitly told not to, nodes on the two chains will still try to relay transactions to each other. That leads to a few scenarios:\n\n>* Old-coin transaction with low fee- overloaded Core chain rejects, 101 chain accepts. Core chain thinks coins haven't moved, 101 chain thinks they have. Double spend possible (spend once with 101 merchant and low fee, spend again with Core merchant and higher fee). Since old coins make up a majority of the market right now, this attack may become common.\n\n>* Old-coin transaction with high fee- overloaded Core chain accepts, 101 chain accepts. Both chains see coins have moved. As long as they are moved to a fresh address they stay 'old' and in sync on both chains. Double spend not possible.\n\n>* Core-coin transaction- rejected by 101 chain as originating address doesn't have coins in it. Double spend not possible.\n\n>* 101-coin transaction- rejected by Core chain either due to insufficient fee or because originating address doesn't have coins in it. Double spend not possible.\n\n>The real problem comes when an address gets mixed coins- for example when you take an old-coin address (such as a paper wallet) and then send coins to it in a transaction that only works on one chain. Now you have two copies of that address, one on each chain, each with different ideas about how many coins are in the address and where they came from. \n\nI will respond to these ideas one by one:\n\n> Old-coin transaction with low fee- overloaded Core chain rejects, 101 chain accepts. Core chain thinks coins haven't moved, 101 chain thinks they have. Core chain thinks coins haven't moved, 101 chain thinks they have.\n\nThat isn't what blockchains think, it is what people think when they are living in the fantasy that \"Bitcoin\" will exist if Core becomes a major \"altcoin\". There will be at least three distinct currencies (or four if we can figure out how to [launch an ethereum clone on the same block that bitcoin 101 forks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aethereum/comments/3xiset/lauch_%C3%A6thereum_on_the_same_block_as_bitcoin_xt/)).\n\n> Double spend possible (spend once with 101 merchant and low fee, spend again with Core merchant and higher fee). Since old coins make up a majority of the market right now, this attack may become common. \n\nWait a second. How many people believe this gibberish? If Core is making blocks much slower than 101, won't [RBF](\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uhc99/optin_fullrbf_just_got_merged_into_bitcoin_core/) make it extremely easy to keep the 101 transactions from being included on Core? **[Update: Apparently it will be easier to split the dual-chain-bitcoins by tainting them. Please ignore my instructions before this edit on New Years day 2016.]** This doesn't even require a modified Bitcoin Core client, does it?\n\nThat isn't really a \"double spend\", that is why a Core client allows it. Let me name the **three currencies that will exist after the fork**:\n\n* Core-bitcoin - bitcoin that is ONLY valid on the Core chain\n* 101-bitcoin - bitcoin that is ONLY valid on the 101 chain\n* Dual-chain-bitcoin - bitcoin residing at the same addresses on both chains and for which a transaction could be valid on both chains (I'm not exactly sure what happens when derps send different transactions to the same addresses on both chains but I do know this is a bad idea.) \n\nThe only way to be sure we have \"Bitcoin\" back is if Core reverts 101 and everyone gives up on 101. If that happens it means that the transaction on the 101 chain was not really a Bitcoin transaction. Either everyone gives up on Core, or we have three currencies, or everyone splits all their dual-chain-bitcoin into the two currencies, and/or Core reverts 101. None of these scenarios require \"double spending\" or a \"51% attack\", they are conflicting/competing definitions of Bitcoin.\n\n>Old-coin transaction with high fee- overloaded Core chain accepts, 101 chain accepts. Both chains see coins have moved. As long as they are moved to a fresh address they stay 'old' and in sync on both chains. Double spend not possible.\n\nYou don't want to be waiting for confirmations on Core every time you spend your 101-bitcoins do you? So the first thing anyone with a brain will want to do is split their dual-chain-bitcoin. Do this by sending bitcoin to a new wallet on the 101 chain and using [RBF](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uhc99/optin_fullrbf_just_got_merged_into_bitcoin_core/) to send it to a different wallet on Core. \n\n>The real problem comes when an address gets mixed coins- for example when you take an old-coin address (such as a paper wallet) and then send coins to it in a transaction that only works on one chain. Now you have two copies of that address, one on each chain, each with different ideas about how many coins are in the address and where they came from. \n\nThat is a small educational problem for the clueless. The real problem is if Bitcoin whales choose Core.\n\nSplitting the dual-chain-bitcoin is going to be a pain in the ass if Core is going very slow with all blocks being filled to the max. Therefore Core miners are likely to use another patch that will prioritize ALL transactions by fee no matter when they were sent (okay you could call this legalized \"double spending\" if you consider unconfirmed transactions to be \"spent\"). The 101 believers will want to sell their Core-bitcoins so they pay very high transaction fees on the Core chain. They will pay these fees with \"Bitcoins\" they have already spent on the 101 chain so this will not be expensive if Core quickly dies as they believe it will. Then Theymos, etc, sell their 101-bitcoins and buy Core-bitcoins. Then more miners go back to Core because it becomes more profitable (even if they want to be paid in 101-bitcoins). We have observed how far the price of Bitcoin can fall when it is one currency and most of the bitcoin has hardly moved. Who is going to buy all Theymos' and Satoshi's 101-bitcoins? Bitstamp? BitPay? [CORE MINERS?!?!?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3yw5cz/what_if_bitcoin_core_becomes_a_major_altcoin/cyi5mxl) Can they even afford to do so? Miners may have to mine both chains just to pay their bills. Then 101 \"investors\" may have big problem.\n\nYou could make a poll of Bitcoin holders and ask when they might buy/sell 101-bitcoins or Core-bitcoins, but just like the miner \"votes\" this isn't any kind of binding commitment. A well-funded [Ethereum prediction market](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3ht8rx/who_will_build_a_better_prediction_market_augur/) would be a very good way to predict the outcome of this battle, especially after the [decentralized Bitcoin exchange Dapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3vsgvo/btc_relay_a_new_way_to_interact_with_the_bitcoin/) has had its [\"security audit\"](http://btcrelay.org/). Notice that Satoshi will soon have a third chain they can buy into without identifying themselves or trusting an exchange. She could also bet on this prediction market. If she is lucky, someone will write an exchange Dapp to allow separate trading of Core-bitcoins, 101-bitcoins, and dual-chain-bitcoins. Bitcoin/ASIC owners would be wise to make sure this Dapp will be available. If Satoshi's only way out of 101 or Core, is to trade them for Ether [or Dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3xc0co/dogeethereum_twoway_peg_i_wrote_up_an/), this bitcoin's price may fall through the floor and many sha256 miners could go out of business.", {"entities": [[8, 15, "crypto"], [103, 110, "crypto"], [2112, 2119, "crypto"], [2776, 2783, "crypto"], [3132, 3139, "crypto"], [3744, 3751, "crypto"], [3891, 3898, "crypto"], [4188, 4195, "crypto"], [4728, 4735, "crypto"], [5279, 5286, "crypto"], [5827, 5834, "crypto"], [6174, 6181, "crypto"], [6630, 6637, "crypto"], [7028, 7035, "crypto"], [7076, 7083, "crypto"], [7510, 7517, "crypto"], [7694, 7702, "crypto"]]}], ["The Doge connection Bounty Dao is live and workingPreviously, on Dogethereum: [A thread appeared on /r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3wxbc3/dogecoin_transfer_onto_ethereum/) asking about how hard would it be to create a side chain for dogecoin-ethereum, in the moulds of btcrelay. The thread gathered a lot of attention and Vitalik jumped in to give his opinions. [Just a few days later Vitalik implemented with a sort of light client for dogecoin in ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3xc0co/dogeethereum_twoway_peg_i_wrote_up_an/), with the caveat that it would take a lot of gas to fully run but he had also a game theoretic solution that could overcome that problem. A Skype room was created by both dogecoin and ethereum developers to discuss what could be changed  to create a fully decentralised side chain, the ultimate goal being to create an ethereum based token that keeps value at 1:1 for a dogecoin and can be used to run smart contracts.\n\nSome people started saying they had an interest in setting up a bounty to help fund this development so I created a DAO to manage those funds. I added some members of the ethereum community, dogecoin developers and ethereum developers, put a 100 ethers of my money to test it and created a proposal to refund it, so we could be sure that the DAO actually works. Yesterday we finally were able to gather enough votes to execute it and the test was successful. I was also able to execute a code adding a new member, so it **as far as I've been able to test it** the DAO works for both ether transactions and code execution, so it should be able to hold tokens too.\n\nThis is the currently rules of the DAO: \n\n* All proposals, in order to be able to be executed need to be at least 1 week (10,000 minutes) old, have at least 5 votes (due to a recently found code typo it's *> minimum quorum* instead of the more logical *>= minimum quorum*), with at least *3* votes supporting it more than the number of votes against it.\n\n* The DAO has 8 voting members: Myself, Vitalik (he has 2 votes), Ming (executive director of the foundation), Piper Merrian (Independent developer), Hudson Jameson (Community member souptacular), Ross Nicoll (dogecoin developer) and George Hallam (Foundation and Ethcore). \n\n* Members can be added or removed, minimum quorum,voting time and majority margin can be changed only by putting up a proposal. Only members can put proposals and vote. \n\n* All proposals and votes are public (although to see who voted on what you'd have to get public logs, something the current wallet doesn't support)\n\nIf you want to donate ethers or any tokens to the DAO, the address is: **0xdbf03b407c01e7cd3cbea99509d93f8dddc8c6fb**\n\nIf you want to watch the proposals and votes, you can [add them to the wallet using these instructions](https://gist.github.com/alexvandesande/d9cc775a6a4d29df76a6)\n\n\nThe [full source code can be found on this gist](https://gist.github.com/alexvandesande/eb6935702e2549d1e510).

Crucially, we're not creating a new currency.\n* Relaying Doge between the Dogecoin and Ethereum chains is probably not something the average shibe will do, but instead you'll simply buy in on whatever side you want. I'm committed to making sure it's something you can do if you want, but generally I expect we'll see limited relays between the two after the initial seeding period. It may well also be that you'll be able to exchange \"native\" Doge for \"Eth\" Doge via decentralised exchange, avoiding the relay process that way (i.e. probably cheaper to do).\n* We're absolutely aware we need to have our miners on board with this plan, and are discussing how best to do that. It's likely relay transactions will be more expensive (aiming for significantly under, say, an international bank transfer though), and again we're absolutely going to keep that as low as we can, but we're adding significant complexity and risk to mining and the miners need to be motivated to take that cost & risk. I'll let you know as soon as we have a worked out plan.\n\nProgress so far:\n\n* Vitalik has written [a prototype for Scrypt on Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3xc0jh/dogeethereum_twoway_peg_xpost_from_rdogecoin_i/) and various Eth devs are looking into optimising it\n* A 5k ETC + 2BTC bounty for the work has been generously donated, and we are sorting out exact details and escrow for that now: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3x9hlf/xpost_rdogecoin_brain_dump_dogecoin_on_ethereum/cy2sg5m\n* I have a draft for the freeze/thaw process, and need feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoindev/comments/3xdliz/sidechain_freezethaw/\n* Miner motivation is still a headache and we'll probably need to work out economic models for how that will look.\n\nHow you can help:\n\n* We need to get the remaining miners to upgrade to 1.8.3 / 1.10.0 to finish the current soft-fork. We're at about 91% of new blocks on the latest version, we need 95% to enforce the fork. There's a bunch more detail on Patrick's post at https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/3u2zn6/could_you_help_us_devs_out/\n* The freeze/thaw process needs technical review, before I go ahead and make it into a formal specification\n* We need more shibes that understand Ethereum to help educate the community.

Binance exchange is world\u2019s top spot crypto exchange based on the volume. \n\nWhen it comes to utility $BNB is one of the top notch crypto currencies. Following are some of them\n1. Gas fee on Binance Chain and Binance  Smart Chain (BSC). Pancake swap is one of the top DEXes on BSC and it contributes a lot of utility to $BNB.\n2. Reducing fee on Binance platform.\n3. Voting on Binance platform.\n4. Access to Launchpad projects (Initial Exchange Offering)\n5. Means of payment for purchasing goods or gift cards.\n6. Trading with the BNB trading pairs.\n\nAs of this writing, BNB total supply is 168,137,036. It keeps getting reduced due to the quarterly burns. \n\nGood stuff:\n1. Top exchange by volume.\n2. Supports a lot of coins/tokens.\n3. Offers a lot of crypto products ranging from Staking, Spot/Derivatives/Margin/Peer to Peer Trading, IEO, Lending, NFTs, Cards, Payments and many more.\n4. Peer to peer trading is one of the easiest way to liquidate crypto assets into fiat currency.\n5. A lot of utility to $BNB and it\u2019s in the top 3 coins by market capitalisation. \n6. Regular updates/AMAs from the CEO.\n7. Platform is very intuitive and easy to use.\n8. Charges less trading fees compares to some other exchanges. \n\nNot so good stuff:\n1. Not known for the regulatory compliance, many regulators have raised concerns and trading of certain products had to be stopped as a result in some countries.\n2. Some banks had blocked fiat support (especially in UK) due to concerns with Binance platform.\n3. Investigation by U.S on possible insider trading and market manipulation.\n4. Binance blockchains (Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain) are generally perceived by many developers and Crypto advocates as centralised and it\u2019s future is very unclear once Ethereum moves to Proof of Stake consensus. \n5. Customer support is not that good and it\u2019s not scaling in line with user growth. \n\nFinal verdict:\n$BNB has a lot of utility and Binance is one of the top and best exchange platforms. Regulatory crackdown is something to keep in mind before you look into it.", {"entities": [[29, 32, "crypto"], [65, 68, "crypto"], [283, 286, "crypto"], [454, 457, "crypto"], [672, 675, "crypto"], [881, 884, "crypto"], [921, 924, "crypto"], [1358, 1361, "crypto"], [2248, 2251, "crypto"]]}], ["One of the main aspects in crypto is Decentralization, but what about Binance Coin?The 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap currently.\n\nI thought that the main key that cryptocurrency is unique of is decentralization.

Funny thing is that the CEO of bnb has been making a disparage remarks about Ethereum, yet they copied their hard work which took years to do. They are completely centralised but make themselves seem decentralized.\n\nYeah, I understand, the eth fees are so expensive that many switched to Binance Smart Chain. But isn\u2019t this what crypto is against the whole time? Doesn\u2019t crypto wanted to avoid this? Isn\u2019t crypto feared of this and fighted against it for years?

Greed has taken over. The whole point of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any true blockchain is that nobody has special permissions or control of the network itself.  There is no back door for someone to mint extra coins at no cost or kick someone off the network or otherwise restrict or control usage.  Once you have your BTC/ETH, they are yours and nobody can mess with them. This is not true with BNB. And besides, Binance Coin is basically a security, the BNB token use the proof-of-authority consensus mechanism. The way it works is that there are 21 pre-approved validators that verify all transactions. Binance is responsible for approving the validators and can add or remove them at their discretion. It\u2019s even referred to as CeFi lol. They have full control over BNB and the binance smart chain and all of its characteristics (quantity of coins etc), how is that any different than a company issuing securities as they have control over the number of shares? The point of cryptocurrency and blockchain was not meant to be just some database in Malta. \n\nCryptocurrency is a technological marvel and solution to one of the oldest problems that has plagued mankind- all the trust required in third parties to store your value and transact freely with one and other. Being a **trusteless and decentralized** system is fundamental to solving this. Without decentralization crypto networks lose their most important qualities of being **trustless, permissionless** and **censorship-resistant** \u2014 that is, that anyone can use the network and anyone can build on top of them. Decentralization is the whole point of any of this, we could do everything much more efficiently with traditional databases if we're willing to trust a central authority and wouldn't need to pay any fees for anything. We've been doing it for decades with centralized finance. BNB is literally a money printing machine for Binance and their friends because nobody they don't approve is allowed to mint it. \n\nI know most people here are purely in for the money, and that\u2019s completely fine but I just wanted to share a reminder of the core tenets of why we have cryptocurrency. Remember the message that Satoshi encoded in the first genesis block. All of this has a purpose, it wasn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme, it was to give power to the people through **decentralisation**. This is truly a peaceful financial revolution based on a core principle, and we just happen to be getting fabulously wealthy along the way. And that\u2019s great.

As of June 2021, Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, supporting more than 1.4 million transactions per second.1\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by the Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol.\n* BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain.\n* Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy, or \"burn,\" Binance coins held in its treasury.\n* Binance was created as a utility token for discounted trading fees in 2017, but its uses have expanded to numerous applications, including payments for transaction fees (on the Binance Chain), travel bookings, entertainment, online services, and financial services.\n* At the time of writing, Binance had a market cap of more than $56 billion and ranks behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USD Tether in terms of market cap.\n\n## Understanding Binance Coin\n\nBinance coin initially ran on the [Ethereum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp)\u00a0blockchain with [ERC 20 standard](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. It was launched during an\u00a0[initial coin offering (ICO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp) in July 2017 and has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. It offered 10%, or 20 million, BNB tokens to [angel investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/angelinvestor.asp), 40%, or 80 million, tokens to the founding team, and the remaining 50%, or 100 million, to the various participants through the ICO process.\n\nAlmost half the funds raised during the ICO process were intended to be used for Binance branding and marketing, while around one-third were used to build the Binance platform and perform necessary upgrades to the Binance ecosystem.\n\nBNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain.\n\n### Biggest Cryptos\n\n*As of August 2021, BNB is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USD Tether.*\u00a0\n\n## Binance Coin Burning\n\nAlthough 100 million Binance tokens were initially offered in the ICO, the current total supply is lower. Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy, or \"burn,\" Binance coins held in its treasury.\n\nBinance has regularly performed these burning events. The latest BNB burn came on April 15, 2021, when Binance burned a total of 1,099,888 BNB, equivalent to $595,314,380 USD worth of tokens. It is Binance's 15th quarterly BNB burn and its largest ever in terms of U.S. dollars. The total supply of BNB has decreased from 170,532,825 to 169,432,937.\n\n## Binance Coin Uses and Support\n\nBinance was created as a utility token for discounted trading fees in 2017. But since then, its uses have expanded to numerous applications on a wide number of platforms. It is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance.com, Binance DEX, and Binance Chain.\n\nIt can also be used for payments (at places like Crypto.com, Monetha, and HTC); to book travel accommodations (at sites such as TravelbyBit, Trip.io, and Travala.com); for entertainment purposes (virtual gifts, card packs, lotteries); to pay for online services (BitTorrent, Canva, Storm); and even for financial purposes (take out a loan at ETHLend or make investments at Moeda).\n\nOne can also use Binance coins to invest in certain ICOs that are listed through Binance\u2019s Launchpad program. New cryptocurrencies list on the Binance exchange, and the use of Binance provides a seamless marketplace for [trading in a variety of established and new virtual tokens](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp).\n\nThe crypto token has garnered support from other partnerships which has helped its usage spread. It includes a partnership with Asia's premier high-end live video streaming platform, Uplive, which sells virtual gifts for BNB tokens to\u00a0Uplive\u2019s 20 million-strong user base.\n\nBinance coin is also supported by the platform, the mobile app, and the VISA debit card of Monaco, the pioneering payments and cryptocurrency platform.\n\n### Binance Smart Chain\n\n*As of June 24, 2021, the Binance Smart Chain was processing as much as 3.7 million daily transactions; triple the amount of Ethereum's all-time high in daily transactions, but down from a record almost 12 million daily transactions reached on May 14, 2021.2*\n\n## BNB FAQs\n\n## What Is the BNB Coin?\n\nBNB Coin is a cryptocurrency that is used primarily to pay transaction and trading fees on the Binance exchange.\n\n **What Is the BNB Coin Used For?**\n\nBeyond the Binance exchange, Binance Coin has several uses, including the ability to:\n\n* Make credit card payments\n* Pay for travel arrangements (on select websites)\n* Buy virtual gifts\n* Process payments\n* Make investments\n* Make loans and transfers\n* Donate to charity\n\n## What Does Convert to BNB Mean?\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, dust refers to any amount of coins or tokens that are so small they're often ignored. They're basically the tiny fractions left from trades.\n\nBinance allows traders to convert their dust into BNB.\n\n## What Is a BNB Market?\n\nThe BNB market simply refers to the place where BNB is bought and sold. Most purchases of BNB take place on the secondary market.\n\nTraders are able to buy and sell BNB on [Binance.com](https://accounts.binance.me/en/register?ref=Q17N7D09) as well as other crypto platforms.\n\n## Is Binance Banned in the U.S.?\n\nBinance is not banned in the U.S. However, on May 13, 2021, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in) that Binance Holdings is under investigation by the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.

It\u2019s time for TrueBurn. \n\nWhat is BURN?\n\nAs most people in DeFi know, a \"burn\" is a popular method used to remove a portion of tokens from circulation. Investors know that these burned tokens will never again be sold, but it yields no additional value.\n\nWhat is REBASE?\n\nAnother recent development is the technique of rebasing. This reduces the total supply of the token everywhere. If dev rebases at 50%, holders\u2019 coins are worth twice as much but they only hold half as many. \u2026Smoke and mirrors. \n\nIn comes TRUEBURN\n\nTo recap, traditional burn locks a portion of the supply, so it will never again be sold. On the other hand, rebasing changes the supply and can have a positive effect on the chart, but this effect is superficial and causes a change to investors\u2019 holdings. The TrueBurn contract combines both burn and rebase: every time a burn happens the token is literally destroyed and removed from supply. In this way, the true supply is actually diminished while the number of tokens held by investors is remains unchanged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay tuned for the rest!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[t.me/trueburnofficial](https://t.me/trueburnofficial) \n\n[www.trueburn.io](https://www.trueburn.io)\n\n[https://twitter.com/TrueBurnBSC](https://twitter.com/TrueBurnBSC)", {"entities": [[193, 196, "crypto"]]}], ["Singapore Blockchain Company \ud83d\udd25 | 2000 BNB hard cap Presale 21 Nov| Certik & Hacken Audited \ud83d\udd12 | SUBX Finance Lab \ud83d\udd25**SUBX Finance Lab is a blockchain company that has been gaining a wide range of attention ever since its start of operations.

While ANJI is currently on Binance Smart Chain, it is designed to be multi-chain and layer fluid. Holders will receive the native token of the blockchain (BNB for Binance Smart Chain) from fees paid on AnjiEco's current and future products, as well as a portion of each transaction of ANJI. Through the protocol, ANJI then also generates contributions to causes to make the world a better place.\n\nSo what exactly will you be able to do with ANJI?\n\nANJI sets a new precedent with the world's first smart contract dividends protocol. Holders can claim their BNB rewards through our platform AnjiSwap. One can freely claim and use as they wish, reinvest and purchase more ANJI with a 50% reduced swap fee, or donate to the AnjiPool, which will support an NGO at the end of the given month.\n\nThe rewards are generated in many ways, and not only with the swap fee of ANJI. AnjiSwap, with its own router, connects investors to liquidity pools. In doing so, each transaction fee is rewarded to ANJI holders in real-time. Effectively you become a Shareholder in the ecosystem.\nAll rewards are given in real-time, preventing possible reward pool manipulation that often occurs in other reward-focused tokens.\n\nWhat is this ecosystem?\n\nAnjiEco is an ever-expanding community of tokens and applications that can use the instruments within the ecosystem. AnjiSwap already lowers the learning curve and connects tokens to potential investors more directly and effectively.\n\nAnjiEco Links:\n\n- App: https://app.anji.eco\n\n- Website: https://anji.eco\n\n- Ecosystem: https://anji.eco/ecosystem\n\n- Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Anji_Eco\n\n- Telegram Chat:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiEco\n\n- Telegram Announcement Channel:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiAnn I\u2019m", {"entities": [[60, 63, "crypto"], [473, 476, "crypto"], [874, 877, "crypto"]]}], ["FYI, for V2 migration, you WILL need BNB for migration gas fees.That's it, I feel a lot of people don't know that.

I've been following the company since MCO days (2017) and at that time Kris has always emphasized they are aiming to be the Amazon of crypto. They are following Amazon's model of reinvesting all profits into growing the company.\n2. Crypto.com is aiming for 100M app users by 2023. Some of those users could avail their crypto cards which means they will be locking up CROs to get their cards. \n3. Users of the cards will also earn CRO cashbacks from their fiat transaction which means that as volume of fiat transactions increase buy pressure of CRO will also increase.\n5. Cronos mainnet has recently launched and already a lot of promising projects are lined up.\n6. Crypto.org chain is IBC (interblock chain communication) enabled which means they are able to communicate with IBC enabled chains such as Cosmos and IRIS net (with more upcoming chains in process of integration).

Each player has rating points. It directly depends on the game and the recognition of the player. For example, scored a goal + 6 points. Red card -2 points. This is a brief and superficial example.\n\nA player's card can always be bought and sold. Player\u2019s cards are an NFT collection that is only getting more expensive every day. This is a new step in the history of art. The 21st century is the beginning of the history of the NFT art. It is developing at an incredible pace, capturing more and more new fans around the world every day.\n\nLook at art as an investment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have a bank of fifa playing cards.

And this at top with the Hollywood names on post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is ANJI?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANJI is a security token built to reward holders for the growth of AnjiEco. While ANJI is currently on Binance Smart Chain, it is designed to be multi-chain and layer fluid. Holders will receive the native token of the blockchain (BNB for Binance Smart Chain) from fees paid on AnjiEco's current and future products, as well as a portion of each transaction of ANJI. Through the protocol, ANJI then also generates contributions to causes to make the world a better place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what exactly will you be able to do with ANJI?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANJI sets a new precedent with the world's first smart contract dividends protocol. Holders can claim their BNB rewards through our platform AnjiSwap. One can freely claim and use as they wish, reinvest and purchase more ANJI with a 50% reduced swap fee, or donate to the AnjiPool, which will support an NGO at the end of the given month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rewards are generated in many ways, and not only with the swap fee of ANJI. AnjiSwap, with its own router, connects investors to liquidity pools. In doing so, each transaction fee is rewarded to ANJI holders in real-time. Effectively you become a Shareholder in the ecosystem.\n\nAll rewards are given in real-time, preventing possible reward pool manipulation that often occurs in other reward-focused tokens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is this ecosystem?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnjiEco is an ever-expanding community of tokens and applications that can use the instruments within the ecosystem. AnjiSwap already lowers the learning curve and connects tokens to potential investors more directly and effectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnjiEco Links:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- App: [https://app.anji.eco](https://app.anji.eco)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Website: [https://anji.eco](https://anji.eco)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Ecosystem: [https://anji.eco/ecosystem](https://anji.eco/ecosystem)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Twitter:\u00a0[https://twitter.com/Anji\\_Eco](https://twitter.com/Anji_Eco)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Telegram Chat:\u00a0[https://t.me/AnjiEco](https://t.me/AnjiEco)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Telegram Announcement Channel:\u00a0[https://t.me/AnjiAnn](https://t.me/AnjiAnn) I\u2019m", {"entities": [[84, 87, "crypto"], [688, 691, "crypto"], [1109, 1112, "crypto"]]}], ["\ud83d\udc36 GreedyDoge - $Gdoge | Fair Launch On PancakeSwap Nov 14 at 17:00 Utc | Real Utility, Buy-Backs, Burns, BNB Rewards! | \ud83c\udf0d Huge Global Marketing Planned & OnGoing | Lots of potentialMeet GreedyDoge.

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!\n\nLet me introduce you to the ICO of 2021, [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! You\u2019re probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts, so allow me explain.\n\nCryptocurrency crimes rose by **1,000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC, **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are\u2026us. And, nobody is stepping up to protect \u2018us\u2019 so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing!\n\n[Verify](https://www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects\u2014new and old\u2014to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own API\u2019s to communicate with API's from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that, users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs, label wallets, track wallet movements, and get a security rating for any project\u2014and more! Our algorithms will create confidence scores for every project so you can make more informed investment decisions. With so many people being scammed daily in BSC (some of us included), we believe this will be a powerful tool to educate investors and deter scammers.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like a much-needed service? And you can get in on it early! **Join our** [Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial) **to get the details about how you can purchase!!!!**\n\nAt this point, you probably want to head over to our website to learn more about Verify Lens and see our timeline\u2014hope to see you soon!\n\n[www.verifytoken.net](https://www.verifytoken.net/)\n\n(Boring but necessary and important stuff):\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Doxxed & experienced team**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Team is available around the clock for questions**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Active community**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Tokenomics with philanthropy**\n\n**\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25**\n\n**10% Sell tax**\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Research and Development\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Charity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% Burn\n\n\ud83d\udca5 ***2% BNB DIVIDEND*** **\ud83d\udca5**\n\n**6% Buy Tax**\n\n\ud83d\udca5 2% R&D\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Liquidity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Charity\n\n\ud83d\udca5 1% Burn\n\n\ud83d\udca5 ***1% BNB DIVIDEND*** **\ud83d\udca5**\n\nGet in touch with us:\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/VerifyOfficial)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ver1fyToken?s=09)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/VerifyToken/)\n\n[Instagram](https://instagram.com/verify.token?utm_medium=copy_link)\n\n\u2026and of course [r/VerifyToken](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)\n\n**Come check out our Verify Family!

The more credits you hold, the better the odds! This encourages new buyers to join, while holders benefit from the added volume by getting 3% WBNB rewards from each buy and sell!\n\nThe roadmap includes a surprise third SPIN Jackpot game that is coming very soon and a SPIN Jackpot style sports and eSports betting platform!

This was at the peak of the last bull run in January of 2018, and BNB was only about $20. Fast forward a few years, and now it\u2019s $500+. And of course, I didn\u2019t invest at the time, and I\u2019m kicking myself for that. I don\u2019t even remember r/cc promoting BNB that much back then, although it\u2019s possible I just missed it. \n\nAnyway, if you look at [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com/compare/crypto-com-chain?vs=binancecoin), it says that CRO has a market cap of $7.3B and BNB has a market cap of $94.3B. If CRO caught up to BNB, it would 12X and go from it\u2019s current price of $0.29 to a new price of $3.73. ([Pic for reference](https://imgur.com/a/NkrRRSo)).\n\nSo\u2026 what would need to happen for CRO to grow that much? Is it really just having more people download the Cropto.com app?

This is what inspired the contract that is now the foundation of TrueBurn. It\u2019s time to remedy these manipulative techniques, which attempt to alter buyer behavior. It is time for a token that does what it advertises. It\u2019s time for TrueBurn. \n\nWhat is BURN?\n\nAs most people in DeFi know, a \"burn\" is a popular method used to remove a portion of tokens from circulation. Investors know that these burned tokens will never again be sold, but it yields no additional value.\n\nWhat is REBASE?\n\nAnother recent development is the technique of rebasing. This reduces the total supply of the token everywhere. If dev rebases at 50%, holders\u2019 coins are worth twice as much but they only hold half as many. \u2026Smoke and mirrors. \n\nIn comes TRUEBURN\n\nTo recap, traditional burn locks a portion of the supply, so it will never again be sold. On the other hand, rebasing changes the supply and can have a positive effect on the chart, but this effect is superficial and causes a change to investors\u2019 holdings. The TrueBurn contract combines both burn and rebase: every time a burn happens the token is literally destroyed and removed from supply. In this way, the true supply is actually diminished while the number of tokens held by investors is remains unchanged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay tuned for the rest!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[t.me/trueburnofficial](https://t.me/trueburnofficial) \n\n[www.trueburn.io](https://www.trueburn.io)\n\n[https://twitter.com/TrueBurnBSC](https://twitter.com/TrueBurnBSC)", {"entities": [[193, 196, "crypto"]]}], ["\ud83d\udfe8 Mello Token \ud83c\udfb0 | BNB deposits available by the end of the week | Huge Giveaway on Twitter | Marketing Wave 24/7! \ud83d\udc8e| The biggest Gem on the BSC with 100x Potential | \ud83c\udf89Are you always looking for moonshots ?

Various billboards throughout central London will introduce DeFi and ANJI to the masses. And this at top with the Hollywood names on post\n\nWhat is ANJI?\n\nANJI is a security token built to reward holders for the growth of AnjiEco. While ANJI is currently on Binance Smart Chain, it is designed to be multi-chain and layer fluid. Holders will receive the native token of the blockchain (BNB for Binance Smart Chain) from fees paid on AnjiEco's current and future products, as well as a portion of each transaction of ANJI. Through the protocol, ANJI then also generates contributions to causes to make the world a better place.\n\nSo what exactly will you be able to do with ANJI?\n\nANJI sets a new precedent with the world's first smart contract dividends protocol. Holders can claim their BNB rewards through our platform AnjiSwap. One can freely claim and use as they wish, reinvest and purchase more ANJI with a 50% reduced swap fee, or donate to the AnjiPool, which will support an NGO at the end of the given month.\n\nThe rewards are generated in many ways, and not only with the swap fee of ANJI. AnjiSwap, with its own router, connects investors to liquidity pools. In doing so, each transaction fee is rewarded to ANJI holders in real-time. Effectively you become a Shareholder in the ecosystem.\nAll rewards are given in real-time, preventing possible reward pool manipulation that often occurs in other reward-focused tokens.\n\nWhat is this ecosystem?\n\nAnjiEco is an ever-expanding community of tokens and applications that can use the instruments within the ecosystem. AnjiSwap already lowers the learning curve and connects tokens to potential investors more directly and effectively.\n\nAnjiEco Links:\n\n- App: https://app.anji.eco\n\n- Website: https://anji.eco\n\n- Ecosystem: https://anji.eco/ecosystem\n\n- Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Anji_Eco\n\n- Telegram Chat:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiEco\n\n- Telegram Announcement Channel:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiAnn I\u2019m", {"entities": [[95, 98, "crypto"], [682, 685, "crypto"], [1083, 1086, "crypto"]]}], ["\ud83d\udca5 zCOIN | $ZCN | 10% BNB rewards | FAIR launch | 500kMcap | 500 holders | Renounced contract | LP locked 2 years | available on FLOOZ \ud83d\udca5 \n\n# zCOIN , The French Patriotes' cryptocurrencyzCOIN ($ZCN) is a BSC token with 10% BNB rewards with NO rebase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Hold $zCOIN and earn huge passive income in $BNB every 60 minutes \ud83d\udd25!\n\n\ud83d\udca5 It's time to Give Back to The Patriots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80 $zCOIN for Zemmour Coin.

Various billboards throughout central London will introduce DeFi and ANJI to the masses. And this at top with the Hollywood names on post\n\nWhat is ANJI?\n\nANJI is a security token built to reward holders for the growth of AnjiEco. While ANJI is currently on Binance Smart Chain, it is designed to be multi-chain and layer fluid. Holders will receive the native token of the blockchain (BNB for Binance Smart Chain) from fees paid on AnjiEco's current and future products, as well as a portion of each transaction of ANJI. Through the protocol, ANJI then also generates contributions to causes to make the world a better place.\n\nSo what exactly will you be able to do with ANJI?\n\nANJI sets a new precedent with the world's first smart contract dividends protocol. Holders can claim their BNB rewards through our platform AnjiSwap. One can freely claim and use as they wish, reinvest and purchase more ANJI with a 50% reduced swap fee, or donate to the AnjiPool, which will support an NGO at the end of the given month.\n\nThe rewards are generated in many ways, and not only with the swap fee of ANJI. AnjiSwap, with its own router, connects investors to liquidity pools. In doing so, each transaction fee is rewarded to ANJI holders in real-time. Effectively you become a Shareholder in the ecosystem.\nAll rewards are given in real-time, preventing possible reward pool manipulation that often occurs in other reward-focused tokens.\n\nWhat is this ecosystem?\n\nAnjiEco is an ever-expanding community of tokens and applications that can use the instruments within the ecosystem. AnjiSwap already lowers the learning curve and connects tokens to potential investors more directly and effectively.\n\nAnjiEco Links:\n\n- App: https://app.anji.eco\n\n- Website: https://anji.eco\n\n- Ecosystem: https://anji.eco/ecosystem\n\n- Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Anji_Eco\n\n- Telegram Chat:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiEco\n\n- Telegram Announcement Channel:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiAnn I\u2019m", {"entities": [[57, 60, "crypto"], [92, 95, "crypto"], [676, 679, "crypto"], [1077, 1080, "crypto"]]}], ["VisionNFT || Just Launched || Presale of 80 BNB Sold Out in 7 Mins || Huge Marketing Push incoming || Multiple Influencers on Board || Utility Coin || CMC & CG IncomingVisioNFT Launched!\n\n\ud83d\udd25Presale Sold Out of 80BNB in 7 Minutes \ud83d\udd25 \n\nWe have a solid project/use case and for that we want longevity and the tokenomics are designed exactly for this\n\nIts going to be much bigger than our previous project.

My mate who is a native sent over the tutorial and I thought I would share. Basically, you can construct a Solidity smart contract to execute the attack for you. Let's say you send 0.15 BNB(the actual amount), but the contract sends arbitry code and the PancakeSwap flash-loan system thinks that you have actually sent 15 BNB. A few lines of code later and the transaction doesn't fully go through and gets cancelled. But here's the fun part - the PancakeSwap flash-loan system actually returns the fake amount and sends you 15 BNB. Unsure whether the dev team is aware of this, though it was tested out today and no issues so far.  \nJUST MAKE SURE TO SEND AT LEAST 0.15 BNB. IF YOU SEND ANY LESS YOU MAY RISK LOSING YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. DO NOT OVERUSE IT AS THEIR API HAS A COOLDOWN.

My mate who is a native sent over the tutorial and I thought I would share. Basically, you can construct a Solidity smart contract to execute the attack for you. Let's say you send 0.15 BNB(the actual amount), but the contract sends arbitry code and the PancakeSwap flash-loan system thinks that you have actually sent 15 BNB. A few lines of code later and the transaction doesn't fully go through and gets cancelled. But here's the fun part - the PancakeSwap flash-loan system actually returns the fake amount and sends you 15 BNB. Unsure whether the dev team is aware of this, though it was tested out today and no issues so far.  \nJUST MAKE SURE TO SEND AT LEAST 0.15 BNB. IF YOU SEND ANY LESS YOU MAY RISK LOSING YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. DO NOT OVERUSE IT AS THEIR API HAS A COOLDOWN. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT DO DURING THIS EXPLOIT.\n\nThe video tutorial is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyObh9\\_14g&t=13s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyObh9_14g&t=13s)\n\nCouldn't believe it, but I just tested it out myself and it worked like charm.

I think people are underestimating the long term value of the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) Arena for the next 20 years. Coinbase hasn't even made a boss move like that. Think of all the big brand companies who's names are on arenas and look at the longer term value growth of their stocks. I know crypto's aren't stocks. However, as we all know, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) is an exchange with real value. I think they are gunning to be bigger than both Coinbase and Binance. My personal opinion (and not financial advice) is buying CRO today is like buy BNB in 2017 for less than $1.00.\n\nEDITED 11/20/21 at 8:20AM:\n\nI don't mind the down votes, it's all good. We are all holding bags of CRO with different outlooks for different reasons. Just keep in mind back in 1999 when James Glassman wrote the book \"DOW 36,000\" the DOW was at around 10,500 and they laughed the guy to scorn screaming all the reasons it would be impossible. Telsa hitting a trillion dollar valuation was laughable and inconceivable by the naysayers, so much so they were short selling TSLA with as much money as they could get their hands on as it was rising into the billions and hundreds of billions in valuation. They pointed to the size of the EV market, more established car manufactures market caps, Tesla making and delivering far less cars, TSLA car crashes, and so on. But look at TSLA price and the short sellers now. I can go on and on and on. My speculation and outlook goes beyond the \"1 + 1 = 2\" mathematics of crypto, circulating supply, utility, and market caps. I have no issue in being wrong about the lofty price, because I'm already right to have bought a few thousand under .18. So, we're all good.

Hello fellow crypto enthusiasts!  It's been nearly a month since my last HOGE (turned HOGE/BNB LP) update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/qiiqmd/1000\\_hoge\\_turned\\_3000\\_hogebnb\\_moonshotting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/qiiqmd/1000_hoge_turned_3000_hogebnb_moonshotting/) \\- high time for another follow up! I think the current moment is kind of cool because my level of impermanent loss is nearly 0 (just 0.11%), meaning that both HOGE and BNB have gone up in the last 5 months at almost exactly the same rate. As always, my bullish view of HOGE means I expect this rate to be drastically higher for HOGE (compared to BNB) in the coming months but I'm earning great trading fees in the meantime. \n\nOK down to the numbers - my originally about $3000 worth of HOGE and BNB is now worth about $13044, a 4.35 times increase. Since I used the HOGE and BNB to provide liquidity on pancakeswap, an increasing chunk of my gains (currently about $3212) is from trading fees earned from pancakeswap trades. The value of my LP is down a bit since my last update (when it was worth $15734), but in the face of the BTC and overall market correction recently I'm extremely happy with how the HOGE and BNB are holding up. \n\nThere have been some cool developments recently that I think will propel HOGE to higher market caps, as well as some very cool upcoming developments. I'll give a shot at a brief, non-exhaustive summary: release of HogeSwap, a BSC-based DEX with some very cool features being worked on, namely the ability for LP holders to vote on setting the trading fee rate for their pair; release of Unifaucet, a BSC-based faucet allowing holders to stake reflectionary tokens to send proportion to the faucet wallet for users to claim - I think the UI needs work but it's a cool tool for any BSC or bridged-Eth token to use. Huge community-based fundraising for exchanges and marketing has gone well - I expect that the rest of Q4 will be extremely bullish for the growing reach and availability of HOGE, with likely BitMart, a top 5 exchange, and a few other top exchanges listing HOGE in the near future. \n\nI'll keep it (relatively) short this time - lot's more bullish happenings and developments out there - links to socials can be found in some of my previous updates (which you can find by following the link trail backwards). \n\nUntil next time!", {"entities": [[1225, 1228, "crypto"], [30, 33, "crypto"], [159, 162, "crypto"], [563, 566, "crypto"], [741, 744, "crypto"], [890, 893, "crypto"], [970, 973, "crypto"], [1310, 1313, "crypto"]]}], ["Spent 1.32 BNB for a 32 Lisa \ud83c\udf75 Hoping whoever sold her is as happy as I am about it! \ud83d\ude39\ud83e\udde9", {"entities": [[11, 14, "crypto"]]}], ["If CRO would have the market cap of BNB, CRO would be on $3.88", {"entities": [[36, 39, "crypto"]]}], ["BABY SATOSHI Day 5 Update!

My mate who is a native sent over the tutorial and I thought I would share. Basically, you can construct a Solidity smart contract to execute the attack for you. Let's say you send 0.15 BNB(the actual amount), but the contract sends arbitry code and the PancakeSwap flash-loan system thinks that you have actually sent 15 BNB. A few lines of code later and the transaction doesn't fully go through and gets cancelled. But here's the fun part - the PancakeSwap flash-loan system actually returns the fake amount and sends you 15 BNB. Unsure whether the dev team is aware of this, though it was tested out today and no issues so far.  \n>  \n>JUST MAKE SURE TO SEND AT LEAST 0.15 BNB. IF YOU SEND ANY LESS YOU MAY RISK LOSING YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. DO NOT OVERUSE IT AS THEIR API HAS A COOLDOWN. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT DO DURING THIS EXPLOIT.\n\nThe video tutorial is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyObh9\\_14g&t=13s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyObh9_14g&t=13s)\n\nCouldn't believe it, but I just tested it out myself and it worked like charm.

While ANJI is currently on Binance Smart Chain, it is designed to be multi-chain and layer fluid. Holders will receive the native token of the blockchain (BNB for Binance Smart Chain) from fees paid on AnjiEco's current and future products, as well as a portion of each transaction of ANJI. Through the protocol, ANJI then also generates contributions to causes to make the world a better place.\n\nSo what exactly will you be able to do with ANJI?\n\nANJI sets a new precedent with the world's first smart contract dividends protocol. Holders can claim their BNB rewards through our platform AnjiSwap. One can freely claim and use as they wish, reinvest and purchase more ANJI with a 50% reduced swap fee, or donate to the AnjiPool, which will support an NGO at the end of the given month.\n\nThe rewards are generated in many ways, and not only with the swap fee of ANJI. AnjiSwap, with its own router, connects investors to liquidity pools. In doing so, each transaction fee is rewarded to ANJI holders in real-time. Effectively you become a Shareholder in the ecosystem.\nAll rewards are given in real-time, preventing possible reward pool manipulation that often occurs in other reward-focused tokens.\n\nWhat is this ecosystem?\n\nAnjiEco is an ever-expanding community of tokens and applications that can use the instruments within the ecosystem. AnjiSwap already lowers the learning curve and connects tokens to potential investors more directly and effectively.\n\nAnjiEco Links:\n\n- App: https://app.anji.eco\n\n- Website: https://anji.eco\n\n- Ecosystem: https://anji.eco/ecosystem\n\n- Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Anji_Eco\n\n- Telegram Chat:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiEco\n\n- Telegram Announcement Channel:\u00a0https://t.me/AnjiAnn", {"entities": [[29, 32, "crypto"], [64, 67, "crypto"], [374, 377, "crypto"], [775, 778, "crypto"]]}], ["\ud83d\ude80 SUBX Finance Lab | PinkSale | Presale | $SFX 2,000 BNB Hard Cap \ud83d\udd25 | Institutional Investors Backing the Project \ud83d\udcaa | Singapore\u2019s own fast-growing Blockchain Company \ud83d\ude80Singapore\u2019s own fast-growing blockchain company to launch its own Token \ud83d\udd25\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSUBX Finance Lab, a Singapore registered company, is set to launch a Presale of their Native Token $SFX on November 21, 3 pm UTC.

This means that if the tokenomics have a function other than reflecting tokens (liquidity, buybacks, etc) it has to sell these tokens on the market.

Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry, paving the way for cryptocurrencies mass adoption. PYECharts, PYESwap, and our NFT marketplace will seamlessly integrate with other platforms built by the well renowned DevTeamSix. A portion of the fees will then be redistributed back to PYE holders, and this is why many of the multimillionaire whales of SafeMoon & SHIB are invested into the next big eco-system in return of passive income in BNB. \n\nThe development team behind this project and others have decades of experience in mass marketing businesses outside of crypto, and many videos of the offices are available over Twitter. https://devteamsix.com/our-team \n\nDevTeamSix are the visionaries behind this cryptocurrency movement.

Not everything is explained in the best way, but I think it is necessary for people to get an idea of \u200b\u200bhow serious the situation is. If people are interested I will write a longer version with much more detail about Tether.\n\n>Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency which aims to **keep cryptocurrency valuations stable**. Tether is used by crypto investors who want to avoid the extreme volatility of other cryptocurrencies while keeping value within the crypto market.\n\n# But why is Tether important?\n\nWell tether is the 4th largest [marketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/es/) cryptocurrency with almost $ 74billions. But tether is important because of the liquidity it brings to the cryptocurrency market, 60% of BTC transactions are made through tether.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.cryptocompare.com\\/coins\\/btc\\/analysis\\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/jg47lerojuy71.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=89aa68292fcb00225a52e92a196d98e4d445e196)\n\nAt higher, most cryptocurrency futures are in USDT, that is, USDT is the currency to which the rest equates.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that we more or less know what Tether is and what its function is in the market, we enter the interesting part of the matter.   I'm only going to get into the issue of what's behind the 1: 1 value with the dollar, I'm not going to get into the issue of bank fraud.\n\n# How does Tether stay on $1?\n\nHow Tether holds its value at one dollar has increasingly become a source of controversy. Tethers are supposed to be issued by Tether Limited \u2018one for one\u2019 when a customer deposits US dollars. The value of Tether in dollars (USDT/USD) does fluctuate but tends to remain very close to one.\n\nBut what if it wasn't equated 1: 1 to the dollar?\n\nTther recently got a [fine](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21) from the CFTC for lying about its reserves.

The [reserves report](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf)made as of March 31 is this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhl9m3zwmuy71.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a6c2bf11f64d6a8553fac3bf52cd997cb115963\n\nTo begin with, it is obvious that there is no 1: 1 parity with the dollar, but not even close. Although if it is true that it has state bonds that I am also very sure. But in that there is no problem, the problem is when we look at the amount of commercial paper that it has, 30 $ billions the commercial paper is what Blackrock handles ...\n\n# Where are the commercial papers from?\n\nAnd now you will say, and why this cares if they are safe?. But this is where China and the Chinese real estate sector come in, because the rumors, which rather than rumors are unconfirmed truths, say that this commercial paper belongs to the Chinese real estate sector (which I assume that everyone already knows that it is not in very good condition).\n\nI know that no one likes Jim Cramer, but at the end of September he [affirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxbJJ-TFR8s) that this commercial paper for Tether was from Evergrande, Tether released a statement later (What they werre going to do but say yes and ruin the company or deny it and we'll see what we make?).\n\n# WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nAnd all this stuff, why? Well, let's imagine that the rumors are true and that the commercial paper that supports the parity of USDT with the dollar, that loses value or that even is not paid. I don't have a clear answer to what will happen next, but I know it could be very, very bad, the cryptocurrency market would become illiquid, there would be a total panic, there would be a tremendous wave of liquidation of BTC and ETH ...\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd in the Fed's November financial stability report, they talk about the risk of stablecoins to the economy in general.\n\n[Change stablecoin for Tether ;\\)](https://preview.redd.it/o9x475lwpuy71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3daf73a0a05deb6632becfcfba445186170f16)\n\nAnd they also put it as a top5 possible cause of a shock in the economy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unf1u7l4quy71.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ecb00084c99a26f2fd6b0b2720b686b85b96c74\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that it does not have much to do with GME, but since I believe that this is a family and we share all the DD that we can, to learn and help each other it seems to me a very important issue so that so little is said.\n\nAnd that if you have found it interesting, I can make another post to explain it better and with more details\n\nBUY HOLD AND DRS\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEDIT:  This picture is not mine, I found this in twitter, but even so I AM NOT AFFIRMING THAT THE COMMERCIAL PAPERS ARE FROM EVERGRANDE, that are rumors, there is nothing confirmed, I know that tether said no, but they are liars with $ 980 million in fines\n\nI think it would be worth as TLDR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4v10qj33vy71.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5d80a1d1e289a26e101e63065d3667b224e428e", {"entities": [[1165, 1168, "crypto"], [4806, 4809, "crypto"], [1, 4, "crypto"], [4814, 4817, "crypto"], [167, 173, "crypto"], [650, 656, "crypto"], [660, 666, "crypto"], [773, 779, "crypto"], [935, 941, "crypto"], [1680, 1686, "crypto"], [1926, 1932, "crypto"], [1950, 1956, "crypto"], [2036, 2042, "crypto"], [2073, 2079, "crypto"], [2152, 2158, "crypto"], [2938, 2944, "crypto"], [2960, 2966, "crypto"], [4202, 4208, "crypto"], [4230, 4236, "crypto"], [5032, 5038, "crypto"], [668, 672, "crypto"], [1264, 1268, "crypto"], [1434, 1438, "crypto"], [1449, 1453, "crypto"], [2171, 2175, "crypto"], [4518, 4522, "crypto"]]}], ["Let's un-Tether.After watching [Coffeezilla's latest Tether video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk23kA3yeDY), it has become clear to me that Tether has become untethered from reality and that we must all, as a community, untether from Tether.\n\nEDIT: The USDT alternative suggestions in the comment section (BUSD, USDC, DAI, UST, PAX, FRAX...) are far better than the [link](https://www.makeuseof.com/stablecoin-alternatives-to-tether-usdt/) I included here (it included Diem. *oof*)\n\nNow, individual action of moving off Tether will help - but it can only scale so far.

It is designed to always have the value of 1 US dollar but cryptocurrency format. They supposedly achieve this by keeping 1 dollar in reserves for each Tether bought. Tether is not the only crypto that has its value pegged to 1 dollar, there are many, i.e., stablecoins. But Tether is by far the most popular. Nearly all crypto exchanges use USDT as a trading pair. What this means is, USDT is the main liquidity provider of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCurrently, there is **68,5 BILLION** Tether in circulation, it is the **5th largest cryptocurrency** by market cap.\n\nNow everything sounds great on paper, 1 dollar for every Tether and all of that. But in reality, Tether Limited is the single sketchiest company that has ever managed to get enormously big. Tether limited has 68,5 billion dollars under management and they have, wait for it, **19 employees.**\n\nThis means that for every employee Tether has, they control **3,6 billion dollars.**\n\nIf you don't understand what this means, let me put it this way:\n\nIn case of Tether crashing, the whole crypto market would be devastated and put back multiple years, all the innovation that crypto aims to bring would be stained by the fiasco that is Tether. I'm certain that we would say goodbye to crypto going mainstream and becoming the main way of finance dreams for a loooong time.\n\nThere are several huge red flags about how they manage the company and their reserves.\n\nLet me talk these red flags:\n\nThey've refused multiple audits to their currency and reserves. Only info until now that us investors had about the situation of their reserves was a half-assed promise the co- founder made in an interview. \n\nIn that same interview, he was asked if Bitfinex and Tether Limited had the same owners, he replied that they weren't related at all, they only worked with the same banks. Well guess what, **he lied.** The truth came out when the Paradise Papers were leaked, shining light to many corporations', elites' and celebrities' and also Tether's secrets.\n\nBitfinex got mixed up in a scandal involving a firm called Crypto Capital, an also shady fiat banking firm that has worked with even shadier clients, including Colombian Drug lords. This firm was unsurprisingly involved in a sex-trafficking scandal and the investigation that followed caused all their clients' holdings to be frozen indefinitely. \n\nSuddenly Bitfinex had nearly 80 percent of their clients money frozen, rendering any withdravals or trades impossible. Now normally a normal exchange in this situation would declare bankruptcy right? No. What Bitfinex did is that they took 400 million dollars worth of Tether's reserves to provide liquidity to their clients.\n\nRemember when I said that no audits were done until now? \n\nThe New York Attorney General launched an investigation on Tether Limited, and they reached a settlement. As a part of that settlement, Tether had to share their holdings completely. \n\nHere's the result:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qiax6b18kjm71.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89a2f4bc9494de19e9ad428104fa15b8b0ea94e\n\nYup, they have **3.87% in cash.**\n\nThere are a lot more sketchy stuff Tether is involved in, but I will not talk about them.

As documented in the recent report (Report) by the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets (the PWG), stablecoins present investor protection risks and raise several market integrity concerns. Consumers\u2019 increased use of stablecoins, and their importance in effecting transactions in digital assets, underscores the need for greater understanding of the basic operation, and limitations, of Tether.\nAs the PWG noted, the market capitalization of stablecoins issued by the largest stablecoin issuers exceeded $127 billion as of October 2021, reflecting an almost 500 percent increase over the prior year. The complex terms and conditions applicable to digital assets and stablecoins, as well as the need for reliable and resilient underlying networks, can make it difficult for investors and consumers to fully understand the details of how those assets function and their potential risks. I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms.\nEven though stablecoins are typically \u201cminted\u201d in exchange for U.S. dollars, or other conventional currency, the purchase of stablecoins through a trading platform may not provide customers with the same rights and entitlements as a direct purchase from an issuer. In addition, customers may have different rights based on the amount of stablecoins owned or transacted. Furthermore, because the term stablecoin is used broadly, users may not appreciate the complexity and distinct features and terms of each stablecoin.\nAccordingly, given the importance of the specifics related to the use of Tether to investors and consumers, please respond to the questions below in clear, straightforward terms. I understand that any response would not affect or change the binding terms or conditions applicable to any particular customer or circumstance, but your ability to provide information that can clarify the basic operational features of Tether is critical to improve the understanding of digital assets.\n\n**1. Please describe the basic purchase, exchange, or minting process[es] by which customers can acquire Tether for U.S. dollars. In your answer, explain any relevant limitations or qualifications to engaging in and completing that process.**\n\n**2. Please detail the process to redeem Tether and receive U.S. dollars. Here, also, identify any requirements or limits, including any minimum redemption size, waiting period, or qualifications.**\n\n**3. Since Tether\u2019s inception, how many Tether tokens have been issued, and how many have been redeemed? Over the last 12 months, what is the greatest percentage of the Tether in circulation at the beginning of a calendar week to be redeemed in the subsequent seven days?**\n\n**4. Briefly characterize the market or operational conditions that would prevent the purchase, or redemption, of Tether for U.S. dollars, or another digital asset. For purposes of answering this question, do not list or describe legal or regulatory limitations currently described in a user agreement or terms of service. For each condition identified, please provide at least one example that occurred in the past 12 months and its duration.**\n\n**5. Please identify any trading platforms that have enhanced capabilities, privileges, or special arrangements with respect to Tether, identifying those features and their basis (e.g., contractual or common control).**\n\n**6. Please summarize any internal reviews or studies your company has conducted about how specific levels of redemptions would affect Tether, including its convertibility into U.S. dollars, or would affect the financial position of your company.** \n\nPlease respond to the above by December 3.

Non Existent Burns. Also performed yesterday.**Why Tether\u2019s Recent Chain Swap Indicates Fraudulent Activity**\n\nIn recent years, cryptocurrency prices have benefited from the increasing adoption of \u201cstablecoins\u201d, a surrogate for fiat currency which have increased market liquidity and made trading of cryptocurrencies more accessible to retail investors. The largest of these \u201cstablecoins\u201d is Tether (also known as USDT) which has the third highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies at approximately US$62.6 billion[\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn1), almost half of which has been generated in the past six months.\n\nAlthough not necessarily well known, USDT is integral to cryptocurrency markets as it facilitates and enables a large portion of daily liquidity, particularly on unregulated exchanges. This can be demonstrated by looking at the volume of USDT that is traded on a daily basis, which is often larger than the trading volume of either Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nAs USDT\u2019s value is \u201cpegged\u201d, it is often overlooked because, for investors, it is an intermediate step for turning the US Dollar into cryptocurrency investments. However, with USDT\u2019s ever expanding role in providing liquidity in cryptocurrency markets and its deeper integration into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it is extremely important for them to conduct their business transparently and with integrity as they are effectively custodians for US$62.6 billion of client monies, which includes your money as USDT is widely used on exchanges such a Binance and, more recently, Coinbase. If, as this article seeks to assert, the value of USDT is likely to be less than the market\u2019s current valuation this has a significant impact on all parties that either hold or interact with third parties that hold USDT, including the exchanges. If exchanges such as Binance, who hold at least USDT17.1 billion[\\[2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn2), are heavily exposed to USDT and it effects their solvency this has a direct implication on your ability to withdraw your funds and your assets, potentially losing vast sums.\n\nThis article draws attention to recent events that, in our opinion, unequivocally demonstrate that Tether are deceptive, fraudulently maintaining the value of USDT to the US Dollar and that their actions are a direct threat to the value of your investments.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n\\- In May 2021, Tether performed a chain swap which resulted in a net increase of USDT1,000,000,000 to the total supply of USDT, contradicting statements made by Tether and its Chief Technical Officer which advised that total USDT supply would not change as a result.\n\n\\- Tether and its Chief Technical Officer have demonstrably lied, artificially creating unbacked USDT with an equivalent value of US$1,000,000,000.\n\n\\- If USDT is not 100% backed by Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, the value of the USDT peg of 1-to-1 to the US Dollar is fraudulent.\n\n\\- If you have sold your cryptocurrency for unbacked USDT you have, to some degree, given your cryptocurrency away for free or at least for a significantly lower value than you believe.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)\n\n**Background**\n\nTether issues a \u201cstablecoin\u201d, also called \u201cTether\u201d or \u201cUSDT\u201d, which is purportedly pegged 1-to-1 with the US Dollar (US$) and acts as a surrogate US Dollar on a number of exchanges throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nTether is integral in providing liquidity in cryptocurrency trading, particularly on unregulated exchanges, on the fundamental premise that each USDT is always redeemable for 1 US Dollar. In order for this to be achieved, Tether\u2019s reserves must be fully backed by stable, low risk and liquid assets that can be exchanged for US Dollars easily such that they can meet requests for US Dollars on demand from customers. The important part to note, for this article, is that USDT must be fully backed by assets for the 1-to-1 peg to be maintained and the \u201cminting\u201d (creation) of each USDT must follow the receipt of 1 US Dollar by Tether, a principle that Tether claims to abide by[\\[3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9hy9k5pjsy71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=130409d5058b82d5f9bc3096cd4cf0e72978ad56\n\nIn circumstances where a USDT is created without a corresponding US Dollar, this dilutes the value of USDT against the US Dollar and should negatively impact the peg of 1-to-1. In our consideration, a recent event unequivocally demonstrates that USDT has been created without corresponding US Dollar inflows \u2013 a narrative that can be shown on the blockchain and through statements made on Twitter by both Tether and its Chief Technical Officer (\u201c**CTO**\u201d), Paolo Ardoino.\n\n**Chain Swap**\n\nUSDT is centralized and created by the \u201cTether Treasury\u201d then issued on two different blockchains, the TRON blockchain (\u201c**TRC20**\u201d) and the Ethereum blockchain (\u201c**ERC20**\u201d), as at June 10, 2021 TRC20 held approximately USDT32 billion and ERC20 held approximately USDT31 billion for an aggregate circulation of approximately USDT63 billion.\n\nA chain swap occurs when parties wish to move an item, such as USDT, from one block chain to another and should not have any impact on the total amount of that item across both blockchains. On a personal level, this is analogous to transferring cash between your personal bank accounts, it changes the amount held in each individual bank account but does not positively or negatively impact the total cash held by the individual (assuming there are no charges for such transactions).\n\nTether announced that it would be performing a chain swap of USDT3 billion from TRC20 to ERC20 and that the total supply of USDT would not change during the process:\n\n\\[3\\] [https://tether.to/](https://tether.to/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhszt7gqjsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f000b3b2357de013ace3350dfb9dcb85791cca9\n\nOn the same date, Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CTO, confirmed the chain swap and advised that it would happen in three separate transactions of USDT1 billion:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a2prqqrjsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e6dc9913c5332ce18a78f7281fbe9f048e3c37\n\nAt the end of the day, Paolo Ardoino then summarized the transactions that took place as part of the chain swap, as shown below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uhhk04tjsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=7182372f51934fa4e8b1a1b245e9bf87098ee958\n\nIn summary, the above statement made by Paolo Ardoino details that Tether authorised the creation of USDT3 billion on ERC20 and destroyed USDT2 billion on TRC20. The net result of the chain swap therefore results in an additional USDT1 billion being in circulation, which can be confirmed by the \u201cTRONSCAN\u201d blockchain analyzer[\\[4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn4), relevant extracts of which are below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqoonc9ujsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=c790c03f90e14fb94a02655af7285865547c8efc\n\nThe above screenshot shows the amount of USDT across TRC20 and ERC20 **before the chain swap** occurs, the aggregate balance is USDT61,910,478,984.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwqas0fvjsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d2b3e88c2a7e6cc5746772ac48a997e2d1d5317\n\nThe above screenshot shows the amount of USDT across TRC20 and ERC20 **after the chain swap** is performed, the aggregate balance is now USDT62,910,478,984 an increase of USDT1 billion.\n\nHowever, after the chain swap is performed, Paolo Ardoino states that there will be an additional \u201cburn\u201d (destruction) of USDT1 billion on TRC20 the following day which, if performed, will result in the **net impact on USDT in circulation being zero** and consistent with Tether\u2019s statement that the total USDT supply would not change.\n\n\\[4\\] [https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eg2a9liwjsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3135517e6ba33cfede86ccc433fe50bda14223e2\n\nAs at today\u2019s date, being June 10, 2021, the USDT1 billion that Paolo Ardoino stated would be burned the following day has not taken place and the total supply is USDT62,905,955,597 or a reduction of only approximately USDT4.5 million compared to the USDT1 billion promised:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4c0knuxjsy71.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=a25d014dfbe3cdb994ac83302aab6eebd5d88ecc\n\n**Implication**\n\nIf the USDT supply is greater than the value of Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, then USDT cannot reasonably be expected to maintain its peg of 1-to-1 to the US Dollar because if all individuals were to redeem their USDT, Tether would have insufficient assets to pay those redemptions, rendering it insolvent. It is critical to understand that drawing a comparison to banks holding fractional reserves is not appropriate or equivalent because the amount of reserves held by a bank does not dictate the value of the US Dollar in the foreign exchange market. If a bank is unable to meet its liabilities and becomes insolvent, this impacts its share price and the credit worthiness of its debt, not the value of the US Dollar. However, the value of Tether\u2019s reserves will have a direct impact on the value of USDT in a properly functioning, transparent market.\n\nAs a result, if USDT supply is greater than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, any party receiving USDT in exchange for their cryptocurrency is, in effect, selling their cryptocurrency for less than fair market value because the USDT they have received is overvalued.\n\nOne can make the argument that, where the USDT supply is only marginally higher than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, the risk is relatively minimal. However, if the USDT supply is substantially bigger than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves this poses a significant risk to any party holding USDT at the point in time that it is discovered.\n\nAs an example, if you were to trade an item of value for gold worth US$10,000, that gold has a value on the spot market which can be publicly viewed at any time. As you believe the gold bar to be genuine, you accept an amount of gold equivalent to US$10,000 in reference to the current spot price for the item of value. However, when you go to a gold dealer to convert the gold in to US Dollars, the gold dealer tests the gold and discovers it is, in fact, primarily copper with a gold casing and the gold dealer then offers you the spot price for the gold casing and copper, which equates to US$1,000. This would have the effect of you selling your item, valued by you at US$10,000, for US$1,000, a 90% decrease.\n\nThis is the overriding concern with USDT and Tether, USDT has the appearance of being equivalent to 1 US Dollar, however, upon further inspection it is highly unlikely that is true because USDT has been created without US Dollar inflows to back the creation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTether and its CTO announced that there would be a chain swap which would not impact the total supply of USDT and that this transaction would take place over two days.\n\nThe transaction that took place on the first day and resulted in a net increase of USDT1 billion to Tether\u2019s total supply. The second transaction that was supposed to take place the following day to offset the additional USDT1 billion created did not take place. This sequence of events demonstrates that Tether and its CTO, Paolo Ardoino, lied as the transactions they stated would have no impact on the USDT in circulation in fact increased the total USDT in circulation by USDT1 billion with no genuine US Dollar inflow to support that creation.\n\nThe question that must then be asked is, if there has been a net increase of USDT1 billion which was not supposed to happen (as per Tether and its CTO\u2019s own statements), how is this USDT1 billion supported by US$1 billion in reserves as the additional creation of USDT is supposed to come from external inflows of US Dollars from parties wishing to exchange those US Dollars for USDT and trade on cryptocurrency exchanges. Tether\u2019s claim that each USDT is backed by reserves is therefore fraudulent.\n\nTo draw this back to a real life example, this is the equivalent of transferring US$3,000 from Personal Account A to Personal Account B and the balance of Personal Account A only being reduced by US$2,000 whilst the balance of Personal Account B being increased by US$3,000, making you US$1,000 richer. This would of course be a pleasant surprise to you as an individual, but it does not happen.\n\nThe really concerning thing is, if Tether and its CTO are prepared to publicly lie so brazenly about the creation of unbacked USDT, what else are they prepared to lie about? The one-page pie chart demonstrating Tether\u2019s \u201cunrivalled transparency\u201d looks even less credible than it did before.\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref1) [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref2) [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref3) [https://tether.to/](https://tether.to/)\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref4) [https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis)", {"entities": [[1016, 1023, "crypto"], [0, 6, "crypto"], [76, 82, "crypto"], [417, 423, "crypto"], [2278, 2284, "crypto"], [2474, 2480, "crypto"], [2620, 2626, "crypto"], [2730, 2736, "crypto"], [2909, 2915, "crypto"], [3352, 3358, "crypto"], [3395, 3401, "crypto"], [3575, 3581, "crypto"], [3797, 3803, "crypto"], [4202, 4208, "crypto"], [4227, 4233, "crypto"], [4853, 4859, "crypto"], [4977, 4983, "crypto"], [5765, 5771, "crypto"], [6140, 6146, "crypto"], [6713, 6719, "crypto"], [7941, 7947, "crypto"], [8761, 8767, "crypto"], [8931, 8937, "crypto"], [9455, 9461, "crypto"], [9612, 9618, "crypto"], [9916, 9922, "crypto"], [10034, 10040, "crypto"], [10923, 10929, "crypto"], [11154, 11160, "crypto"], [11423, 11429, "crypto"], [11628, 11634, "crypto"], [12005, 12011, "crypto"], [12296, 12302, "crypto"], [12806, 12812, "crypto"], [12982, 12988, "crypto"], [439, 443, "crypto"], [721, 725, "crypto"], [922, 926, "crypto"], [1041, 1045, "crypto"], [1214, 1218, "crypto"], [1548, 1552, "crypto"], [1676, 1680, "crypto"], [1841, 1845, "crypto"], [1920, 1924, "crypto"], [2027, 2031, "crypto"], [2338, 2342, "crypto"], [2540, 2544, "crypto"], [2581, 2585, "crypto"], [2684, 2688, "crypto"], [2824, 2828, "crypto"], [2882, 2886, "crypto"], [2955, 2959, "crypto"], [3060, 3064, "crypto"], [3407, 3411, "crypto"], [3720, 3724, "crypto"], [4046, 4050, "crypto"], [4155, 4159, "crypto"], [4473, 4477, "crypto"], [4550, 4554, "crypto"], [4694, 4698, "crypto"], [4937, 4941, "crypto"], [5158, 5162, "crypto"], [5202, 5206, "crypto"], [5263, 5267, "crypto"], [5343, 5347, "crypto"], [5826, 5830, "crypto"], [5889, 5893, "crypto"], [6246, 6250, "crypto"], [6747, 6751, "crypto"], [6784, 6788, "crypto"], [6876, 6880, "crypto"], [7247, 7251, "crypto"], [7334, 7338, "crypto"], [7523, 7527, "crypto"], [7619, 7623, "crypto"], [7653, 7657, "crypto"], [7791, 7795, "crypto"], [7888, 7892, "crypto"], [7975, 7979, "crypto"], [8338, 8342, "crypto"], [8456, 8460, "crypto"], [8512, 8516, "crypto"], [8544, 8548, "crypto"], [8720, 8724, "crypto"], [8795, 8799, "crypto"], [8925, 8929, "crypto"], [9515, 9519, "crypto"], [9584, 9588, "crypto"], [9661, 9665, "crypto"], [9791, 9795, "crypto"], [9873, 9877, "crypto"], [9993, 9997, "crypto"], [10113, 10117, "crypto"], [10914, 10918, "crypto"], [10931, 10935, "crypto"], [11067, 11071, "crypto"], [11259, 11263, "crypto"], [11406, 11410, "crypto"], [11544, 11548, "crypto"], [11728, 11732, "crypto"], [11776, 11780, "crypto"], [11799, 11803, "crypto"], [11950, 11954, "crypto"], [12055, 12059, "crypto"], [12137, 12141, "crypto"], [12252, 12256, "crypto"], [12321, 12325, "crypto"], [12897, 12901, "crypto"]]}], ["Mask of Bakris Light Dodges through Top Tree Tether TrapTitle says it all.

Though denying it's Evergrande debt, with default looming and its systemic effects on the China money market, this this is a Lehman Brother's-level \"Gray Rhino\" event in cryptoIn the last 24 hours, $56 Billion in USDT volume was traded. That is more than Bitcoin, ETH, and the next 3 largest coins combined. It is the glue holding the world of crypto exchanges together.\n\nI'm sure most of you have seen the movie \"The Big Short\". For the simplified cliff notes refresher - Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, huge batches of dog-shit mortgages at high risk of default were being bundled up into various securities and bonds, which were then bought and sold by financial institutions around the world. When the defaults started rolling in....bla bla bla....global financial system collapses. Any financial institution holding the dog shit went down (either ending in bankruptcy or government bailout). Cool, remember that.\n\nSo Tether FUD has been a meme since Tether was a thing...for good reason too. Since inception, the stablecoin has been caught up in a seemingly endless stream of shadiness and legal issues. A bunch of the OG Tether execs/funders charged with bank fraud, ties to other fraudulent crypto criminal activities, shady ties to Bitfinex, The NYAG suing Tether/Bitfinex and holding them liable for lying about reserves and hiding, the current DOJ investigation...etc etc\n\nAround 2019, Tether low key changed the claim on its website from \"We are backed 1-to-1 with cash\", to \"we are backed by cash and cash equivalents\". Of course this was swept under the table quickly in wild wild west cryptoverse.\n\nSince January 2020, Tether's market cap (and distributions) has exploded from just $4+ Billion to now over $62+ Billion. Supposedly all safely backed by some form of financial reserve.\n\nAfter the NYAG situation, earlier this year Tether was forced to finally publicly disclose their reserve composition. Although they didn't reveal much, the Microsoft Word-quality pie chart they posted did confirm that in fact just a fraction of their holdings is actual cash...the vast majority being held in \"Commercial Paper.\"\n\nWhat's commercial paper? It's short-term (unsecured) debt issued by companies. They're typically used to raise money for short term funding needs like buying inventory, payroll, or pre-paying construction vendors\u2026.kind of like an \"IOU\" of the corporate world. It usually gets a rating, and is usually pretty safe...so long as the companies issuing it remain solvent.\n\nAs of the latest Attestation by their sketch accountant shows Tether holds just $6.2 Billion in cash, $30.8 Billion in commercial paper, the rest T-Bills and RRPs. [https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether\\_assuranceconsolidated\\_reserves\\_report\\_2021-06-30.pdf](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf)  \n\nWith it now in the open that these coins are actually operating more like unregulated money market funds, over the last several months alone the SEC, CFTC, DOJ, congressional financial committees, and the US Treasury department all set their sights on cracking down on stablecoins.\n\nFurthermore, since Commercial Paper is traded at a discount to Face Value, Tether can buy up dog shit junk bonds for pennys on the dollar, but report it as the full maturity amounts on their balance sheet. Great for their balance sheet\u2026horrible if there\u2019s a run on Tether redemptions. \n\nA lot of moonbois and Crypto maxis tried to shrug all of this off, saying \"STFU FUDbois, who cares? They have a fractional reserve, regular banks do the same shit.\"\n\nThis is true, except traditional banks are not gambling most of it in dog shit debt (at least hopefully not to the degree they pre-2008). Money market funds are pretty transparent with what they're invested in. And overall like them or not traditional banks are FDIC insured, meaning your funds are actually \"safu\" in the event of a run. \n\nProblem with Tether is that to this day, they still refuse to disclose the makeup of their commercial paper. Furthermore, at Tether's size they would be one of the biggest investors in the entire commercial paper market. However major players in the US investment markets claim they've never even heard of them. https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a\n\nSo this has all lead to speculation that maybe their paper is in fact Chinese paper. Why does this matter? \n\nOver the last 2 years, Chinese property developers have been issuing debt like crazy. So much so that the Chinese government has recently begun to significantly crack down on it, fearing a thread to their entire financial system. The biggest culprit is a company called Evergrande, who has run up a tab of over $300 Billion in debt, and is at risk of default any day. Trading of their bonds were halted last week. https://gulfnews.com/business/property/chinas-evergrandes-moment-of-truth-arrives-as-bond-payment-deadlines-loom-1.82361403\n\nAs Tether's huge influx of insurances coincided with the Chinese property development debt surge, many began to speculate that Tether's holdings could in fact be Evergrande debt. \n\nPressure on Tether regarding their reserves continued to mount until finally several weeks ago they released an attestation containing the supposed ratings of their paper holdings. They basically said \"Don't worry, all of our paper is rated A2 and above.\"\n\nExoneration? Not really. Remember that scene in the Big Short when Steve Carell's character was going to the bond rating agencies only to find out that it was all a big pay-to-play scheme. The agencies gave pretty much everybody a high rating regardless of actual risk. Well...its the same thing in China. https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/understanding-chinas-bond-ratings/ It's all pay to play, everyone is given a high ratings, and the ratings don't really mean shit.\n\nCase in point, Evergrande's rating was AA up until just a few days ago. https://www.barrons.com/articles/evergrande-suspends-trading-of-onshore-corporate-bonds-after-downgrade-51631786843\n\nBasically, Chinese commercial paper is the equivalent of mortgage backed securities circa 2007. \n\nAs pressure continued to build, and with regulators circling them like hawks, last week Tether finally made a public statement claiming they do not hold any Evergrande debt. They said \u201cTether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,\u201d But, they never said it wasn't Chinese paper at all.\n\nThen just yesterday, Stuart Hoagner, Tether's lawyer put out a tweet saying.  \" If the concern is Evergrande, see our earlier statement. If the concern is Chinese CP, as such, we have published the ratings on our portfolio...\"\n\nThis is essentially lawyer speak for \"We do hold Chinese paper, but don't worry because it has super good ratings\". \n\nSo Tether is pretty much confirmed at least some or all of its paper reserves is Chinese. And if that's true, a good portion of it is probably dog shit debt right now. It does not matter if the debt is Evergrande, if the worst case scenario happens, and Evergrande defaults, the effects will be systemic throughout Chinese capital markets. The entire Chinese market will seize up. \n\nThis event would cause the value of Tether's reserve holdings to plummet with it. If that happens, either the coin becomes unbacked, or they're forced to suck liquidity out of the market (burning coins). This is catastrophic for USDT and for crypto in general.\n\nIf Tether goes down, USDC or any other stablecoin will not have nearly enough liquidity to bail it out.  This is the Lehman-brothers gray rhino event of the crypto world.\n\n This is not FUD, this is a real situation you should pay attention to.\n \n**TL;DR** Tether's lawyer basically confirmed they're holding a Chinese commercial paper time bomb. If Evergrande goes down, so will Tether's holdings.", {"entities": [[375, 382, "crypto"], [384, 387, "crypto"], [21, 27, "crypto"], [68, 74, "crypto"], [1051, 1057, "crypto"], [1084, 1090, "crypto"], [1256, 1262, "crypto"], [1394, 1400, "crypto"], [1525, 1531, "crypto"], [1762, 1768, "crypto"], [1972, 1978, "crypto"], [2688, 2694, "crypto"], [3368, 3374, "crypto"], [3558, 3564, "crypto"], [4099, 4105, "crypto"], [4211, 4217, "crypto"], [5114, 5120, "crypto"], [5238, 5244, "crypto"], [5304, 5310, "crypto"], [6394, 6400, "crypto"], [6491, 6497, "crypto"], [6697, 6703, "crypto"], [7009, 7015, "crypto"], [7425, 7431, "crypto"], [7654, 7660, "crypto"], [7907, 7913, "crypto"], [8030, 8036, "crypto"], [333, 337, "crypto"], [7618, 7622, "crypto"], [7672, 7676, "crypto"]]}], ["This cryptocurrency could bring down bitcoin (and maybe more) / SPIEGEL story on Tether>[*SPIEGEL.de*](https://SPIEGEL.de) *story translated from German into English using* [*DeepL.com*](https://DeepL.com)*.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# This cryptocurrency could bring down bitcoin (and maybe more)\n\nThe billion-dollar online currency Tether could trigger a meltdown in the cryptocurrency market, critics fear. Could the so-called stablecoin even endanger the financial system?\n\nIn the past, only nerds were interested in cryptocurrencies. And today? The U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is taking care of it herself. Under Yellen's leadership, the U.S. president's top financial experts devoted their latest recommendations not to banks or the real estate market - but to so-called stablecoins like Tether.\n\nThe digital currency was launched in 2014 by a former child actor, among others, and established itself - alongside bitcoin - as a popular exchange currency in the crypto world. Today, five years later, investors have invested more than $70 billion in Tether, according to the company, and that's not just giving America's financial watchdogs sleepless nights. It's as if a snowball fight escalated to the point \"that the heads of the armed forces had to be called in to prevent nuclear war,\" according to Bloomberg Business Week.\n\nThe Tether is the largest and most popular stablecoin in the world, with billions worth of Tethers changing hands on crypto exchanges every day. Its success is built on a simple promise: A Tether is always worth pretty much exactly one dollar, and anyone who has a Tether can exchange it for a dollar with the provider if they want. But what if that doesn't work - because the provider doesn't have enough dollars in reserves to do so?\n\nCritics warn of a meltdown for the crypto world, which in the worst case could even have consequences for the global financial system. \"If the Tether disappears, most of the cryptocurrency world is likely to disappear,\" says computer scientist Nicholas Weaver, one of the most vocal critics of the stablecoin.\n\nAnd that might just be the beginning of a much bigger problem. That's because stablecoins, for which there are as yet few binding regulations, link the brave new world of cryptocurrencies to the old world of finance. \"A run out of stablecoins could have contagion effects on the financial system,\" write the experts at the International Monetary Fund IMF in their stability report.\n\nThis would make stablecoins as helpful in a financial crisis as a fire extinguisher that someone has secretly filled with gasoline. But can it really be that the invention of a few computer nerds is endangering the financial system? And if so, how could it come about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Many questions, few answers**\n\nQuestions that one would like to ask the head of Tether: According to the Tether website, it's J.L. van der Velde, but not much more than a photo can be found there. According to his LinkedIn profile, the CEO lives in Asia, and there seem to be hardly any appearances or interviews from him. He is not available for an interview with SPIEGEL. Tether says van der Velde works \"hard behind the scenes\" and maintains \"contacts with customers and counterparties,\" but as the head of a private company, he does not value the limelight. They see themselves as a technology company, he said, which is why the chief technology officer gives regular interviews.\n\n\"Van der Velde seems to be a phantom,\" says data scientist Bennett Tomlin, who has been studying Tether for years - and has collected a whole host of oddities surrounding the company. It starts with the protagonists of the unlikely success story: One of the two Tether inventors, Brock Pierce, used to be a child actor. He has long since parted ways with the project, and in 2020 he ran as a candidate for the U.S. presidential election.\n\nOne of his partners in starting the company was banker Philip Potter, who lost his Wall Street job shortly after showing off expensive purchases. And Tether's acting chief financial officer, Giancarlo Devasini, used to be a plastic surgeon. He then got into computer trading. That apparently didn't always go smoothly: back in the 1990s, Devasini paid Microsoft about $50,000 over product piracy allegations.\n\nAt the time, Devasini had bought software from a business partner with certificates of authenticity that only later turned out to be counterfeit, Tether says today. \"Although Mr. Devasini did not know that the software was pirated, Mr. Devasini agreed to the payment .... Agreed.\"\n\nA mysterious boss, a former child actor and an ex-beauty surgeon - that sounds more like the character list for a Netflix comedy than the ingredients for a billion-dollar financial business. But although stories of inconsistencies and conflicts with the law have accompanied Tether for years, that doesn't dampen demand.\n\nAccording to one popular theory, Tether coins are used by investors to easily move larger sums of assets back and forth between crypto exchanges. Such an exchange currency is needed by traders, for example, who take advantage of minimal price differences on different trading venues. \"Tether tokens are being used to transform everything from digital payments to e-commerce to transactions in decentralized financial solutions,\" the company says. The stablecoin will also be used for cross-border payments and remittances in emerging markets, it added.\n\nCritics of Tether, on the other hand, see the stablecoin as a kind of air pump that keeps inflating the Bitcoin bubble. Conveniently, the makers of Tether not only control the largest stablecoin, but also one of the ten largest Bitcoin exchanges, the Bitfinex Bitcoin exchange. Supporters of the pump theory point to the study of two economists who examined the boom of Bitcoin in 2017. According to the study, a large investor at that time mainly bought new Tether when the Bitcoin price had dropped - and thus drove the price up again. Tether critic Weaver also believes that Tether is mainly used to drive the price of cryptocurrencies to ever new heights.\n\nTether firmly rejects this and attests to the study's methodological deficits. The authors did not understand the crypto market, he said, and their conclusions were built on a \"house of cards that suffers from the lack of a complete data set.\" \"Tether and its related parties have never used Tether tokens to manipulate the crypto market or token price,\" the company said. It is \"completely false\" to claim that Tether tokens are issued to enable illegal activity, it added. \"Tether's growth is not the result of manipulation, it is the result of Tether's efficiency, adoption and widespread utility in the cryptocurrency system.\"\n\nBut it's not just the unabated demand for Tether that's puzzling: In fact, a Tether should always be worth a dollar. After all, investors receive a Tether for every dollar they entrust to the creators - the provider itself is financed by fees. But what becomes of the dollars that Tether has collected? For years, the provider promised that for every virtual coin spent, the corresponding amount of cash would be in Tether's reserves. On its homepage, it said, \"Every Tether is always backed 1:1 by traditional currencies in our reserves.\" But that was apparently just a red herring.\n\nIn reality, Tether's reserves are much smaller. In March of this year, for example, the cash portion was in the single digits, according to company data. That's according to a statement Tether published after pressure from New York Attorney General Letitia James. \"Tether's claim that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,\" James said in February when presenting a settlement. Tether had to pay a multimillion-dollar settlement, and the provider is also banned from doing business in New York state. Tether makes a point of saying that it has not admitted any wrongdoing.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (CFTC) also found that Tether misrepresented the situation for years - and fined Tether $41 million. \"In fact, Tether reserves were not 'fully deposited' during most of that time,\" the agency said. In addition, Tether makers allegedly blithely moved funds to Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, which they also controlled, to plug a financial hole there. Tether had also claimed that its reserves were regularly reviewed by auditors. But that never happened, the supervisors said. Again, Tether stresses that it has not admitted any wrongdoing. \"We are happy to put this matter behind us and look forward to moving forward.\"\n\nBut if Tether's money isn't mostly in cash, where has it ended up? Here's where it gets complicated - but really interesting: According to the company, the lion's share of its reserves is invested in so-called \"commercial papers,\" which are short-dated corporate bonds. Instead of hard dollars, Tether apparently holds mainly corporate bonds. The company does not disclose which companies are involved, even upon request.\n\nNevertheless, Tether sees itself as a \"leader in transparency\" and emphasizes that the \"vast majority\" of its securities have a good credit rating. When buying, the company observes limits for individual issuers and regions and adheres to applicable industry standards. Also, \"none of the commercial paper purchased by Tether is issued by an affiliated company.\"\n\nIt's hard for outsiders to verify that. That's because there are quarterly certifications, to be sure. Auditors, however, have not certified Tether's reserves to date, although Tether has been promising such audits for years. \"Audits are underway and will be completed in due course,\" Tether says. It is challenging to find appropriate auditors in the world of digital tokens, he adds.\n\nOthers don't want to wait that long: short-seller Hindenburg Research - an investor betting on falling prices - has now offered a $1 million reward for clues that reveal more about the composition of the ominous reserves. Tether expert Tomlin says, \"I don't think anyone but Tether knows what's in the reserves.\"\n\nIf the information is correct and Tether's reserves are indeed mostly corporate bonds, that might not be reassuring news: according to the figures, Tether already holds more commercial paper than most money market funds in the U.S. and Europe, experts at ratings agency Fitch calculate. The stablecoin would be one of the biggest players in the world in that market. \"A sudden mass redemption of Tether tokens could threaten the stability of short-dated credit markets.\"\n\nThe company aims to address such concerns. \"We hold a strong, conservative and liquid portfolio with a focus on securing our reserves.\" All commercial paper would mature within a year or less, with a third maturing within 90 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Like the Wild West**\n\nBut what if customers want their money faster? The scenario that supervisors fear: In a crisis of confidence, large numbers of investors could try to exchange their stablecoins for real dollars in one fell swoop. To trigger investors, Tether would have to dump the bonds on the market - which could lead to a crash with contagion effects. Financial watchdogs call that a \"bank run.\"\n\nTether counters: the price of the stablecoin has remained stable even during bitcoin price crashes, and customers have been able to exchange their Tether back without any problems. The cash reserves have always been sufficient so far. \"Tether has been stress tested several times, which it passed with flying colors, and has never refused a redemption in its history.\"\n\nThat said, other financial firms have claimed the same, and they no longer exist. In fact, Tether's business model is reminiscent of a bank that accepts money from customers and invests it in other types of assets - except that strict rules have long applied to banks.\n\nPhilipp Sandner, head of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, advocates subjecting stablecoins to tougher rules as well - but these should not nip innovation in the bud: \"The success of Tether and Co. shows that there is a need for stable exchange currencies in the crypto world.\"\n\nSandner believes that trustworthy stablecoins will prevail on the market. For example, in addition to Tether, there have long been other stablecoins that go by names such as \"True USD\" or \"Paxos.\" All of them are pegged to the US dollar. \"These competitors are growing faster than Tether, so they are making up market share,\" says the blockchain expert. \"But at the same time, central banks are working on their own digital currencies that could one day serve as a medium of exchange.\"\n\nUntil then, supervisors are tightening the reins: \"The lack of adequate oversight poses risks to users and the system in general,\" Treasury Secretary Yellen warned Monday as the presidential task force presented its report on stablecoins. The overseers warn of potential \"risks to the broader financial system\" - and fear that in the absence of oversight, stablecoins could also be used for money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe panel is therefore recommending that the U.S. Congress enact a whole range of measures by law. Probably the most drastic proposal: in the future, Stablecoins should only be allowed to be issued by financial institutions with deposit insurance, i.e. banks. For companies like Tether, which do not have a banking license, this would be an enormous hurdle.\n\nThe move was already expected. \"History has shown us that private forms of money don't last long,\" exchange chief overseer Gensler said in a recent interview, comparing stablecoins to poker chips and insisting on stricter rules.\n\nGensler is not alone in reminding the history of stablecoins of the Wild West, when resourceful businessmen opened their own banks to issue bills.\n\nOften, the branches were hidden in the deepest wilderness, far from the area where the bills were in use. They were therefore called \"wildcat banks.\" Many a contemporary who made the long journey to see for himself the supposed reserves of the banks was in for a surprise.\n\nFor example, a state inspector's visit to the Bank of Jackson County in Michigan in 1838 to see the bank's reserves is documented. Once there, he did come across many large boxes. But when he asked a teller to open them, he found only a handful of silver coins.\n\nAmong them were nails. And broken glass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource:  [Stablecoin Tether: Diese Kryptow\u00e4hrung k\u00f6nnte nicht nur den Bitcoin ins Wanken bringen - DER SPIEGEL](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/stablecoin-tether-diese-kryptowaehrung-koennte-nicht-nur-den-bitcoin-ins-wanken-bringen-a-31356b93-2a68-4108-8f13-bc1b7c3dcb23)\n\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](https://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)", {"entities": [[5539, 5546, "crypto"], [5663, 5670, "crypto"], [5695, 5702, "crypto"], [5805, 5812, "crypto"], [5910, 5917, "crypto"], [8229, 8236, "crypto"], [14472, 14479, "crypto"], [81, 87, "crypto"], [320, 326, "crypto"], [789, 795, "crypto"], [1050, 1056, "crypto"], [1334, 1340, "crypto"], [1421, 1427, "crypto"], [1519, 1525, "crypto"], [1595, 1601, "crypto"], [1910, 1916, "crypto"], [2823, 2829, "crypto"], [2848, 2854, "crypto"], [3117, 3123, "crypto"], [3525, 3531, "crypto"], [3690, 3696, "crypto"], [4017, 4023, "crypto"], [4423, 4429, "crypto"], [4834, 4840, "crypto"], [4914, 4920, "crypto"], [5166, 5172, "crypto"], [5446, 5452, "crypto"], [5583, 5589, "crypto"], [5894, 5900, "crypto"], [5973, 5979, "crypto"], [6013, 6019, "crypto"], [6096, 6102, "crypto"], [6341, 6347, "crypto"], [6388, 6394, "crypto"], [6508, 6514, "crypto"], [6572, 6578, "crypto"], [6643, 6649, "crypto"], [6770, 6776, "crypto"], [6805, 6811, "crypto"], [6876, 6882, "crypto"], [7009, 7015, "crypto"], [7144, 7150, "crypto"], [7196, 7202, "crypto"], [7325, 7331, "crypto"], [7499, 7505, "crypto"], [7578, 7584, "crypto"], [7730, 7736, "crypto"], [7853, 7859, "crypto"], [7993, 7999, "crypto"], [8051, 8057, "crypto"], [8081, 8087, "crypto"], [8181, 8187, "crypto"], [8316, 8322, "crypto"], [8449, 8455, "crypto"], [8594, 8600, "crypto"], [8882, 8888, "crypto"], [9024, 9030, "crypto"], [9329, 9335, "crypto"], [9515, 9521, "crypto"], [9551, 9557, "crypto"], [9659, 9665, "crypto"], [9983, 9989, "crypto"], [10036, 10042, "crypto"], [10109, 10115, "crypto"], [10223, 10229, "crypto"], [10471, 10477, "crypto"], [11048, 11054, "crypto"], [11197, 11203, "crypto"], [11344, 11350, "crypto"], [11433, 11439, "crypto"], [11658, 11664, "crypto"], [12059, 12065, "crypto"], [12257, 12263, "crypto"], [12436, 12442, "crypto"], [13355, 13361, "crypto"], [14423, 14429, "crypto"]]}], ["Something is Tethered to crypto and Evergrande but I\u2019m not sure what it could be \ud83e\udd14", {"entities": [[13, 19, "crypto"]]}], ["Evergrande and TetherIm a heavy looper here and ready to HODL but there is one thing on my mind regarding Tether and their commercial paper with Evergrande. \nThe situation is looking worse as time goes and if the CCP doesn\u2019t  do anything about it, Evergrande will indeed default and Tether will be hurt by it.

But it's a just a fraction less.  \n\nIt might not seem like much but if you multiple this by how many exchanges agree to use tether by how many transactions per hour especially during panic selling or Bull markets...  It adds up.    Outside investors will see this Opportunity, and dump their money into Tether holdings to pump more tethers into the market.      When regulatory agencies Demand to see the dollars backing up each tether... I believe 95% must be backed up.   They show them the accounts.  \n\n  All they do is use some of the profits and reinvest to create more tether.    That's all. \n\n They show up with all the dollars. \n\nSo tether is actually legit.  Think if it as a service fee for giving you a portal.    It's like a legal worm in the system.    It's effing genius.  Because they are all bankers and investment groups.

Non Existent Burns. Also performed yesterday.**Why Tether\u2019s Recent Chain Swap Indicates Fraudulent Activity**\n\nIn recent years, cryptocurrency prices have benefited from the increasing adoption of \u201cstablecoins\u201d, a surrogate for fiat currency which have increased market liquidity and made trading of cryptocurrencies more accessible to retail investors. The largest of these \u201cstablecoins\u201d is Tether (also known as USDT) which has the third highest market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies at approximately US$62.6 billion[\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn1), almost half of which has been generated in the past six months.\n\nAlthough not necessarily well known, USDT is integral to cryptocurrency markets as it facilitates and enables a large portion of daily liquidity, particularly on unregulated exchanges. This can be demonstrated by looking at the volume of USDT that is traded on a daily basis, which is often larger than the trading volume of either Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nAs USDT\u2019s value is \u201cpegged\u201d, it is often overlooked because, for investors, it is an intermediate step for turning the US Dollar into cryptocurrency investments. However, with USDT\u2019s ever expanding role in providing liquidity in cryptocurrency markets and its deeper integration into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it is extremely important for them to conduct their business transparently and with integrity as they are effectively custodians for US$62.6 billion of client monies, which includes your money as USDT is widely used on exchanges such a Binance and, more recently, Coinbase. If, as this article seeks to assert, the value of USDT is likely to be less than the market\u2019s current valuation this has a significant impact on all parties that either hold or interact with third parties that hold USDT, including the exchanges. If exchanges such as Binance, who hold at least USDT17.1 billion[\\[2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn2), are heavily exposed to USDT and it effects their solvency this has a direct implication on your ability to withdraw your funds and your assets, potentially losing vast sums.\n\nThis article draws attention to recent events that, in our opinion, unequivocally demonstrate that Tether are deceptive, fraudulently maintaining the value of USDT to the US Dollar and that their actions are a direct threat to the value of your investments.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n\\- In May 2021, Tether performed a chain swap which resulted in a net increase of USDT1,000,000,000 to the total supply of USDT, contradicting statements made by Tether and its Chief Technical Officer which advised that total USDT supply would not change as a result.\n\n\\- Tether and its Chief Technical Officer have demonstrably lied, artificially creating unbacked USDT with an equivalent value of US$1,000,000,000.\n\n\\- If USDT is not 100% backed by Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, the value of the USDT peg of 1-to-1 to the US Dollar is fraudulent.\n\n\\- If you have sold your cryptocurrency for unbacked USDT you have, to some degree, given your cryptocurrency away for free or at least for a significantly lower value than you believe.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)\n\n**Background**\n\nTether issues a \u201cstablecoin\u201d, also called \u201cTether\u201d or \u201cUSDT\u201d, which is purportedly pegged 1-to-1 with the US Dollar (US$) and acts as a surrogate US Dollar on a number of exchanges throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nTether is integral in providing liquidity in cryptocurrency trading, particularly on unregulated exchanges, on the fundamental premise that each USDT is always redeemable for 1 US Dollar. In order for this to be achieved, Tether\u2019s reserves must be fully backed by stable, low risk and liquid assets that can be exchanged for US Dollars easily such that they can meet requests for US Dollars on demand from customers. The important part to note, for this article, is that USDT must be fully backed by assets for the 1-to-1 peg to be maintained and the \u201cminting\u201d (creation) of each USDT must follow the receipt of 1 US Dollar by Tether, a principle that Tether claims to abide by[\\[3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n631h3kwfsy71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d44a162423ead5908badb15efb78031ee5c5df9\n\nIn circumstances where a USDT is created without a corresponding US Dollar, this dilutes the value of USDT against the US Dollar and should negatively impact the peg of 1-to-1. In our consideration, a recent event unequivocally demonstrates that USDT has been created without corresponding US Dollar inflows \u2013 a narrative that can be shown on the blockchain and through statements made on Twitter by both Tether and its Chief Technical Officer (\u201c**CTO**\u201d), Paolo Ardoino.\n\n**Chain Swap**\n\nUSDT is centralized and created by the \u201cTether Treasury\u201d then issued on two different blockchains, the TRON blockchain (\u201c**TRC20**\u201d) and the Ethereum blockchain (\u201c**ERC20**\u201d), as at June 10, 2021 TRC20 held approximately USDT32 billion and ERC20 held approximately USDT31 billion for an aggregate circulation of approximately USDT63 billion.\n\nA chain swap occurs when parties wish to move an item, such as USDT, from one block chain to another and should not have any impact on the total amount of that item across both blockchains. On a personal level, this is analogous to transferring cash between your personal bank accounts, it changes the amount held in each individual bank account but does not positively or negatively impact the total cash held by the individual (assuming there are no charges for such transactions).\n\nTether announced that it would be performing a chain swap of USDT3 billion from TRC20 to ERC20 and that the total supply of USDT would not change during the process:\n\n\\[3\\] [https://tether.to/](https://tether.to/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i7it2vxfsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=964172d699d4f0535509225670d170a24db1c321\n\nOn the same date, Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CTO, confirmed the chain swap and advised that it would happen in three separate transactions of USDT1 billion:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7z1e9l4zfsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbdb1a2f6079b5a29074280748be811dbe28f7\n\nAt the end of the day, Paolo Ardoino then summarized the transactions that took place as part of the chain swap, as shown below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi5piea0gsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=9367f679c4ca2504e095fb27312c059dfff6366f\n\nIn summary, the above statement made by Paolo Ardoino details that Tether authorised the creation of USDT3 billion on ERC20 and destroyed USDT2 billion on TRC20. The net result of the chain swap therefore results in an additional USDT1 billion being in circulation, which can be confirmed by the \u201cTRONSCAN\u201d blockchain analyzer[\\[4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftn4), relevant extracts of which are below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6xcrsg1gsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e72a0ae769f1bd674bcbba7105714d511c49845\n\nThe above screenshot shows the amount of USDT across TRC20 and ERC20 **before the chain swap** occurs, the aggregate balance is USDT61,910,478,984.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iz2gx8n2gsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a22062c3a7a620d0483164c3c2bf15b4012d738\n\nThe above screenshot shows the amount of USDT across TRC20 and ERC20 **after the chain swap** is performed, the aggregate balance is now USDT62,910,478,984 an increase of USDT1 billion.\n\nHowever, after the chain swap is performed, Paolo Ardoino states that there will be an additional \u201cburn\u201d (destruction) of USDT1 billion on TRC20 the following day which, if performed, will result in the **net impact on USDT in circulation being zero** and consistent with Tether\u2019s statement that the total USDT supply would not change.\n\n\\[4\\] [https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ja8evpq3gsy71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df404b01b1fedb34e9a79eacd3f1b4f31d81c3a\n\nAs at today\u2019s date, being June 10, 2021, the USDT1 billion that Paolo Ardoino stated would be burned the following day has not taken place and the total supply is USDT62,905,955,597 or a reduction of only approximately USDT4.5 million compared to the USDT1 billion promised:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/merhpmu4gsy71.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a42c574804237b6dfb1ab651b48654ca0d8957\n\n**Implication**\n\nIf the USDT supply is greater than the value of Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, then USDT cannot reasonably be expected to maintain its peg of 1-to-1 to the US Dollar because if all individuals were to redeem their USDT, Tether would have insufficient assets to pay those redemptions, rendering it insolvent. It is critical to understand that drawing a comparison to banks holding fractional reserves is not appropriate or equivalent because the amount of reserves held by a bank does not dictate the value of the US Dollar in the foreign exchange market. If a bank is unable to meet its liabilities and becomes insolvent, this impacts its share price and the credit worthiness of its debt, not the value of the US Dollar. However, the value of Tether\u2019s reserves will have a direct impact on the value of USDT in a properly functioning, transparent market.\n\nAs a result, if USDT supply is greater than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, any party receiving USDT in exchange for their cryptocurrency is, in effect, selling their cryptocurrency for less than fair market value because the USDT they have received is overvalued.\n\nOne can make the argument that, where the USDT supply is only marginally higher than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves, the risk is relatively minimal. However, if the USDT supply is substantially bigger than Tether\u2019s US Dollar reserves this poses a significant risk to any party holding USDT at the point in time that it is discovered.\n\nAs an example, if you were to trade an item of value for gold worth US$10,000, that gold has a value on the spot market which can be publicly viewed at any time. As you believe the gold bar to be genuine, you accept an amount of gold equivalent to US$10,000 in reference to the current spot price for the item of value. However, when you go to a gold dealer to convert the gold in to US Dollars, the gold dealer tests the gold and discovers it is, in fact, primarily copper with a gold casing and the gold dealer then offers you the spot price for the gold casing and copper, which equates to US$1,000. This would have the effect of you selling your item, valued by you at US$10,000, for US$1,000, a 90% decrease.\n\nThis is the overriding concern with USDT and Tether, USDT has the appearance of being equivalent to 1 US Dollar, however, upon further inspection it is highly unlikely that is true because USDT has been created without US Dollar inflows to back the creation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTether and its CTO announced that there would be a chain swap which would not impact the total supply of USDT and that this transaction would take place over two days.\n\nThe transaction that took place on the first day and resulted in a net increase of USDT1 billion to Tether\u2019s total supply. The second transaction that was supposed to take place the following day to offset the additional USDT1 billion created did not take place. This sequence of events demonstrates that Tether and its CTO, Paolo Ardoino, lied as the transactions they stated would have no impact on the USDT in circulation in fact increased the total USDT in circulation by USDT1 billion with no genuine US Dollar inflow to support that creation.\n\nThe question that must then be asked is, if there has been a net increase of USDT1 billion which was not supposed to happen (as per Tether and its CTO\u2019s own statements), how is this USDT1 billion supported by US$1 billion in reserves as the additional creation of USDT is supposed to come from external inflows of US Dollars from parties wishing to exchange those US Dollars for USDT and trade on cryptocurrency exchanges. Tether\u2019s claim that each USDT is backed by reserves is therefore fraudulent.\n\nTo draw this back to a real life example, this is the equivalent of transferring US$3,000 from Personal Account A to Personal Account B and the balance of Personal Account A only being reduced by US$2,000 whilst the balance of Personal Account B being increased by US$3,000, making you US$1,000 richer. This would of course be a pleasant surprise to you as an individual, but it does not happen.\n\nThe really concerning thing is, if Tether and its CTO are prepared to publicly lie so brazenly about the creation of unbacked USDT, what else are they prepared to lie about? The one-page pie chart demonstrating Tether\u2019s \u201cunrivalled transparency\u201d looks even less credible than it did before.\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref1) [https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref2) [https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref3) [https://tether.to/](https://tether.to/)\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/StablecoinsFraud/submit#_ftnref4) [https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t/analysis)", {"entities": [[1016, 1023, "crypto"], [0, 6, "crypto"], [76, 82, "crypto"], [417, 423, "crypto"], [2278, 2284, "crypto"], [2474, 2480, "crypto"], [2620, 2626, "crypto"], [2730, 2736, "crypto"], [2909, 2915, "crypto"], [3352, 3358, "crypto"], [3395, 3401, "crypto"], [3575, 3581, "crypto"], [3797, 3803, "crypto"], [4202, 4208, "crypto"], [4227, 4233, "crypto"], [4853, 4859, "crypto"], [4977, 4983, "crypto"], [5765, 5771, "crypto"], [6140, 6146, "crypto"], [6713, 6719, "crypto"], [7941, 7947, "crypto"], [8761, 8767, "crypto"], [8931, 8937, "crypto"], [9455, 9461, "crypto"], [9612, 9618, "crypto"], [9916, 9922, "crypto"], [10034, 10040, "crypto"], [10923, 10929, "crypto"], [11154, 11160, "crypto"], [11423, 11429, "crypto"], [11628, 11634, "crypto"], [12005, 12011, "crypto"], [12296, 12302, "crypto"], [12806, 12812, "crypto"], [12982, 12988, "crypto"], [439, 443, "crypto"], [721, 725, "crypto"], [922, 926, "crypto"], [1041, 1045, "crypto"], [1214, 1218, "crypto"], [1548, 1552, "crypto"], [1676, 1680, "crypto"], [1841, 1845, "crypto"], [1920, 1924, "crypto"], [2027, 2031, "crypto"], [2338, 2342, "crypto"], [2540, 2544, "crypto"], [2581, 2585, "crypto"], [2684, 2688, "crypto"], [2824, 2828, "crypto"], [2882, 2886, "crypto"], [2955, 2959, "crypto"], [3060, 3064, "crypto"], [3407, 3411, "crypto"], [3720, 3724, "crypto"], [4046, 4050, "crypto"], [4155, 4159, "crypto"], [4473, 4477, "crypto"], [4550, 4554, "crypto"], [4694, 4698, "crypto"], [4937, 4941, "crypto"], [5158, 5162, "crypto"], [5202, 5206, "crypto"], [5263, 5267, "crypto"], [5343, 5347, "crypto"], [5826, 5830, "crypto"], [5889, 5893, "crypto"], [6246, 6250, "crypto"], [6747, 6751, "crypto"], [6784, 6788, "crypto"], [6876, 6880, "crypto"], [7247, 7251, "crypto"], [7334, 7338, "crypto"], [7523, 7527, "crypto"], [7619, 7623, "crypto"], [7653, 7657, "crypto"], [7791, 7795, "crypto"], [7888, 7892, "crypto"], [7975, 7979, "crypto"], [8338, 8342, "crypto"], [8456, 8460, "crypto"], [8512, 8516, "crypto"], [8544, 8548, "crypto"], [8720, 8724, "crypto"], [8795, 8799, "crypto"], [8925, 8929, "crypto"], [9515, 9519, "crypto"], [9584, 9588, "crypto"], [9661, 9665, "crypto"], [9791, 9795, "crypto"], [9873, 9877, "crypto"], [9993, 9997, "crypto"], [10113, 10117, "crypto"], [10914, 10918, "crypto"], [10931, 10935, "crypto"], [11067, 11071, "crypto"], [11259, 11263, "crypto"], [11406, 11410, "crypto"], [11544, 11548, "crypto"], [11728, 11732, "crypto"], [11776, 11780, "crypto"], [11799, 11803, "crypto"], [11950, 11954, "crypto"], [12055, 12059, "crypto"], [12137, 12141, "crypto"], [12252, 12256, "crypto"], [12321, 12325, "crypto"], [12897, 12901, "crypto"]]}], ["Is Tether connected to GME?There has been something bothering me about Tether (USDT) in the larger picture surrounding GameStop and I finally got to the point of digging into it.

This means that they did not have money to buy back Tether from the market. Why were people selling their Tether? Well, it was announced that [four of Tethers main banks](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/200) would no longer being doing business with them. People started selling. So, what does Tether do?\n\nHere is the abstract from a [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12903) by John M. Griffin (University of Texas) looking at this specific event:\n\n>This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, influenced Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the 2017 boom. Using algorithms to analyze blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. The flow is attributable to one entity, clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests insufficient Tether reserves before month-ends. Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis of unbacked digital money inflating cryptocurrency\u00a0prices.\n\nMy take away is, they basically minted Tether, bought BTC with it to artificially increase the price of BTC, and then used those BTC as their reserves.\n\nQuick side note on this - during the time without a major bank, \"Devasini\u2019s executives \\[were\\] so desperate that they considered chartering a jet and flying pallets of cash out of the country\" - Ken plane people - Do you think he's flying cash for Tether?\n\nThere was also something else I found interesting around this time and that is Overstock. If you are not familiar with Patrick Byrne and OSTK, he is basically the OG for taking on naked short selling. Here is a [video of him from 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZheZ-EHVsM) explaining the exact problem that GME is currently experiencing and his solution (spoiler:something about taking them behind the barn and killing them).\n\nSo, in 2017, he announced a SEC authorized blockchain-based trading platform and a [ICO for t0](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1130713/000113071317000045/pressreleasetzeroico.htm).\n\n[Here is a podcast of him talking about it](https://badcryptopodcast.com/2017/10/16/patrick-byrne/)\n\nI will admit, I need to dig this deeper, but it basically seems like t0\u2019s ICO was a way to remove naked shorts from OSTK.\n\nDuring this time, the same a$$hat we have seen writing articles against GME on Motley Fool wrote [this article](https://archive.ph/2MnxV) (it's a link to an archived site so you don't give them ad revenue - hehe) against OSTK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mb7jq6p1qt71.png?width=2370&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a59250025a0303920142a688ec9b38dae81ed5a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOSTK experienced a significant run-up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7h7f8ir1qt71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c386032944bedf2d9f1c828793f421e0ebb5f5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTether continued to experience volatility:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ttrqvus1qt71.png?width=2632&format=png&auto=webp&s=a314f566130d1575219e6c3b4328e2f7a880d129\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd BTC reached a never before seen high:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pv6t1u7u1qt71.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac556d5f3e1c5cd69aa78dad6414b6bee9ccb53\n\nThis continued until both BTC and OSTK plummeted in January of 2018.\n\nMy speculation is that they plummeted due to a new financial asset being offered in December 2017: [BTC Futures](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/12/18/cme-bitcoin-futures-price-above-20k-in-first-day-trading/). I explored this some in a previous post about [CME Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/Autisticats/comments/ojrh8x/chicago_mercantile_exchange_cme_group_and_citadel/), but basically they are cash settled (meaning no BTC is transacted) self certified (as in they approved it themselves with the CFTC) futures contracts on BTC. Why is this important? Well, if you can control the price of BTC, as shown above with Tether, then you can make sure your futures contracts always pay out. These futures contracts would be very helpful if you needed to offset losses, say due to a large naked short position in the quickly rising OSTK stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, well, what about GME? Well, I think the exact same thing is happening with GME. Basically, the infinite money machine of Tether is providing enough capital to avoid margin calls through crypto futures. What happened after the run up in GME in January? CME Group starts offering [ETH futures](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/17/valid-points-how-cme-ether-futures-work-and-why-they-matter/). What happened before the May run up? They start offering [Micro-BTC futures.](http://investor.cmegroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cme-group-announces-launch-micro-bitcoin-futures)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore futures = more assets\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and the price of BTC and ETH (and pretty much every other crypto if you control BTC) is controlled, so you can make sure they always pay. What has Tether done in the past year? [Ballooned to over $69B that cannot be located.](https://www.ndtv.com/business/a-crypto-mystery-wheres-the-69-billion-backing-stablecoin-tether-2568271)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther things of interest:\n\nIn [this](https://tether.to/statement-on-tethers-settlement-with-the-cftc/) statement, the CFTC (the same one that the CME Group self certified its BTC futures with) basically said they reviewed Tethers operations and found no issue. Ha, okay\u2026\n\n[\"On November 5, 2018, as an executive of Tether Mr Devasini lent 900 million dollars to Bitfinex and as an executive of Bitfinex, Mr Devasini signed the receipt to Tether.\"](https://nicolaborzi.medium.com/the-lawless-rollercoaster-of-bitcoin-enriches-few-investors-while-many-often-lose-everything-f9b4789444c2)\n\n[Tether lends with Bitcoin as collateral](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/tether-has-lent-1b-to-celsius-network-report/)\n\nThis whole account is dedicated to exposing the corrupt entity of Tether: [https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed](https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed) The founder of Tether actually hates this account so much that he put a bounty on doxxing them so he can file lawsuits.\n\nApparently there are also USDTUSD Futures contracts and they have had some volatility recently around the same time GME did:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0o9twev1qt71.png?width=2910&format=png&auto=webp&s=57086ce53449856f893109114891fdad8a581a58\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, since banks are extremely resistant to working with crypto, Tether is one of the few who will trade crypto for USD and USD for crypto.

Because it\u2019s not fully backed the run would lead to solvability problems.

He was [caught lying](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwji9arA0IbyAhWdqksFHQd1BUsQFjAPegQIFBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitfinexed.medium.com%2Fthe-audio-recordings-bitfinex-doesnt-want-you-to-hear-44d677cf1094&usg=AOvVaw0D0tmWgWnqbm6eG-Qha3U2) about the fact that Bitfinex and Tether were two seperate companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***Giancarlo Devasini***\n\nHe is the chief financial officer at Bitfinex, and at Tether. He joined shortly after Rafael and Brock created it.\n\nDevasini was born in Turin in 1964 and trained as a doctor at the University of Milan. His first calling was as a plastic surgeon, although he quit the profession just two years out of university in 1992 after despairing at the job. \u201cAll my work seemed like a scam, the exploitation of a whim,\u201d he told an Italian art gallery in 2014. He recounted his particular frustration that one woman could not be talked out of reducing her breasts even though they \u201cfit her perfectly\u201d, as he put it. He then quit and embarked on a career dealing in electronics and built a group of companies in Italy.\n\nIn 1996, not long after he had left medicine for business, he paid 100m lira in a counterfeiting settlement with Microsoft. A decade later, in 2007, Toshiba sued another of his entities, Acme, for alleged infringement of its patents for DVD format specifications. In 2006, one of his companies, Alcosto, bought 1,575 memory chips from a UK business. A UK tax tribunal in 2016, found that the transaction was one of several \u201clinked to fraudulent tax losses\u201d. In March 2010, another of Devasini\u2019s companies, a Monaco entity called Perpetual Action Group, was banned from Tradeloop, the online used-electronics marketplace. A month earlier, an American buyer had complained about $2,000 worth of memory chips they had bought from PAG. \u201c\\[One\\] box was filled with a large block of wood,\u201d the buyer claimed.\n\nIndustry executives say he is the key decision maker at two companies that now sit at the heart of the opaque daily flows of crypto money worth billions of dollars. Earlier this year, the New York attorney-general, Letitia James, said Tether had lied in the past about its reserves and called Devasini and his colleagues \u201cunlicensed and unregulated individuals\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system\u201d.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI encourage everyone to watch [Coffeezilla's video on Tether](https://youtu.be/-whuXHSL1Pg).

Firstly, thank you for checking out this potential moonshot $BFK - Baby Fort Knox (www.babyfortknox.com) \n\n$BFK is a buyback token with USDT rewards, with use case in the form of a gaming token where users can P2E for free OR rewards based, and buy NFTs that double as playable game characters which can be upgraded and sold in the $BFK Marketplace or 'black market'. The BFK team is providing investors multiple avenues to earn cryptocurrency and taking advantage of the NFT hype and pushing the limits of NFT use cases and memecoin projects. \n\nWe're all now thinking what is $BFK and why should we invest? \n\nThis is not just any BSC Token, it's also an NFT Gaming project with USE CASE. \n\nDYNAMIC TOKENOMICS : tax increases after buybacks are engaged to protect price floors - refer to website\n\nBuy Tax 12% \n- 3 % Usdt rewards \n- 1 % Liquidity \n- 4 % Marketing/Development \n- 4 % Buyback & Burn \n\nSell Tax 12% - 24% ( Min - Max) \n- 3 - 6 % Usdt rewards \n- 1 - 2 % Liquidity \n- 4 - 8 % Marketing/Development  \n- 4 - 8 % Buyback & Burn Max \n\nTransaction is 0.3 % of max supply. \n\nAntibot will be incorporated during the launch phase.\n\nHere are some of their tokenomics explanations:\n\n1. VAULT SECURITY Auto LP + randomized big buyback at support/resistance levels. LP swap threshold is 10%. Generated LP will be removed once it reaches the threshold, the native token gets burned; BNB goes to buyback contract.\n\n2. THE GREEN ZONE After COUNTERSTRIKE (buyback), the \"vault is unlocked\"; where buy tax reduced to 5% for one hour, and sell increased to 15% and slides back down to 12% over the hour. \n\n3. COUNTERSTRIKE\nAuto buyback & burn. Fixed amount on set time intervals, for example, X amount BNB every 1-4 hours. Can be set to any time frame, or have on for limited time per day - this activates LOCK DOWN. \n\n4. LOCK DOWN \nAfter Auto BuyBacks - Sell Tax increase by double or X then slowly decrease over X time until next buyback. 12% to 24% back to 12% over 1 hour. \n\n5. PAY OUT \nHolders of $BFK rewarded in USDT dividends - auto distribution every hour. \n\n6. TREASURY \nMarketing/Development Tax - Tax contributes towards marketing/Development fund on every buy/sell of 4%, 4-8% respectively during Close The Vault. After reviewing these tokenomics on their website and Whitepaper, I realised just how genius this is. Their tokenomics allow for long term sustainability and growth.\n\nNote: to execute sell might need to increase slippage. For example, if dashboard is showing 15% sell tax, users may need to set slippage to 15%+(16%) = 31% , while only 15% sell tax will be charged even when 31% slippage is used, this can be verified on transaction record blockchain - everyone is encouraged to view this.\n\nPROJECT DETAILS : \n\nThis token has utility as it is an NFT Gaming Project on the BSC network. The game being built is a Play to Earn (P2E) Game with 1v1 up to 5v5 where you can play free or stake tokens or NFT ownership in winner takes all. You will also be able to team up in regularly held dungeons, and unite against enemies to win tokens, loot, and experience points needed to upgrade your NFT characters. \n\nThis team already has many features of their project they have developed before even launching yet.

But let me tell you how there's a better alternative which is also decentralized, that's UST in the terra network.\n\nUST is a Luna ecosystem stable coin which is backed by the terra ecosystem and it runs as a algorithmic stable coin. UST is pegged to the terra ecosystem which makes sure the price stays as 1$ \n\nUST runs in a mechanism where if UST value goes above 1$ then luna is bought into to mint more UST to bring down the price and when price falls down less than 1$ Luna is sold into to increase the price of UST to its 1$ range. UST actually withstand the recent fall really great without any slip in Prices. \n\nUST can be used to stake under the anchor protocol which gives you another 19% APR every year at Fixed rate.\nUST is also used for mirror protocol where you can buy mAssets with UST including stocks and crypto.\n\nCurrently UST is ranked at 31 and it's just a matter of time when it becomes the widest usage in Crypto ecosystem. UST is not yet available in many huge exchanges yet it has already shown it's real potential.\n\nWith decentralisation and no drop in prices , UST is currently the best stable coin out there where you park your funds without any hassle.

I then turn my Algo to Yieldlys(YLDY). I began with 25% of my portfolio and now I am at 200% of my portfolio size(reasoning is because I am infatuated with the de-fi app and strongly believe the Algo ecosystem will be one of the top 5 blockchains). Then I head over to https://app.yieldly.finance/, connect my wallet, and start staking my yieldly for other coins.. I have separated 25%, 25%, 50% on different pools. 75% is going directly to the pools with the highest APY\u2019s(reasoning is because of kuCoin, more on that later)  and 25% winning me 53%(at the moment). This allows me to compound on a daily basis. so I am restocking my yieldly in the yieldly/algo pool.\n\nAs for Kucoin\u2026 I am now claiming my staked coins, then heading back to https://app.tinyman.org/, swapping to algo(more liquidity), then swapping Algo to USDT.

We are developing the world's first ever blockchain that provides passive income through frictionless yield. In partnership with the team at Passive Income ($PSI), we are looking to launch this revolutionary new technology with Bjorn Mattens (Passive Income CEO) as our lead advisor.  \n \n\u25aa\ufe0fJoin us on this adventure and earn regular USDT as early adopters of the TetherMoon ($TRM) project and blockchain. The TetherMoon token ($TRM) will become the main token of this new blockchain, ensuring that the token has a long term use-case. Investing in the TetherMoon project at this stage means investing in a new blockchain like no other. TetherMoon is looking to change the crypto world as we introduce new concepts, new principles and a brand new consensus mechanism that does not exist yet.  This is the first stop in our journey as we develop a blockchain that delivers frictionless yield to all its holders!  \n \n\u25aa\ufe0fOver the coming months TetherMoon and Passive Income will work together on the TetherMoon project, developing the blockchain. The blockchain we are developing will be unique in many ways as the concept does not yet exist in this form. We are to introduce a blockchain that will be based on BaaS (blockchain as a service) and frictionless yield.  This allows additional chains to be created within the Tethermoon blockchain, with their own economies and can then be delivered as a service. This allows companies to create their own chain based on the Tethermoon chain but with subtle differences to ensure it stands out on its own. \n \n\u25aa\ufe0fIn addition to a brand new blockchain, we will also introduce a new way of validating on the network. Throughout crypto history we have seen multiple ways of becoming a validator on the network. Bitcoin's proof of work consensus mechanism requires computational power and Ethereum currently works according to the same mechanism but is moving towards a proof of stake which requires people to buy a certain amount of tokens to become a validator.  These consensus mechanisms require extra computational power, human interaction and additional money to become a validator. Currently this can be achieved by mining, staking or other non-inclusive ways. As time passes, these methods are becoming harder and harder for the majority of our world\u2019s population, making it very difficult to become a validator on these networks. We are about to change this.  \n \n\u25aa\ufe0fOn our blockchain, all collected fees will be shared in a frictionless manner to all holders. This requires no action other than being an owner of the main token within the network (TetherMoon $TRM). When a determined number of tokens has been accumulated (either by buying or collecting through frictionless yield), you will automatically become a validator on the network. As a validator, you will then also share in additional validator dividends on top of the rewards sent through our frictionless yield mechanism. We will soon publish a detailed whitepaper that goes into more depth about the economics and tokenomics of the project.  \n \n\u25aa\ufe0fFor now, we are able to share the basic tokenomics of the TetherMoon $TRM token. The initial tax policy is adjustable and will be changed in the future when the blockchain will be launched. In addition, the supply will be burned partially when the blockchain launches. The TetherMoon $TRM project has been fair launched with no presale so everyone has the chance to participate into this project on equal basis. \n  \n\ud83d\udcb0 Total supply: 1 quadrillion  \n \n\ud83d\udd03Transaction Fee Breakdown \u2935\ufe0f  \n \n\ud83d\udfe2 Buying tax: 15% (10% -

I'm not gonna bother diggin up this dead whore because its 2021 and we've got google.  \n\n\nI always wondered why so many people refuse to use the other stable coins and still opt for tether. Well, after recently getting into different lending protocols in defi such as Aave and also using the lending tool on kucoin (love both of these very much btw) it became painfully obvious. The returns when lending/depositing USDT is typically anywhere from 2-4 times as high as other stable coins to even getting as high as 10x the returns you'd get if you were using usdc, dai, or any other coin. Not one other coin is a better earner.

The most effective way to generate additional revenue is to replace the traditional payment method and find the alternative method. For the traditional payment platform, users should install several programs on their devices at all cost in order to achieve centralized security and access to the server network. In addition, users must go through step-by-step authentication procedures to execute the program.

Both had an extended accumulation period prior to launching their respective mainnets, then ran hard in the months post-launch. Check the charts for each (box marks date of mainnet launch):  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe token price for each was just a small fraction of what it would ultimately become post-mainnet.\n\nSo let\u2019s answer one of our \u201creverse engineering\u201d questions\u2014how were these projects perceived prior to the mega pump? Were there bullish events taking place behind the scenes? Here are screenshots from a few old news articles I dug up:  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \nAt the time these articles were published, Fantom and Solana were barely a blip on the radar. But a quick scan and you can see that the ingredients were there for great success in the future for both projects\u2014revolutionary tech, major partnerships, institutional connections, VC funding, etc.  \nLet\u2019s go down the list for Beyond Protocol.  \n\n\n* **Revolutionary tech** that solves a major problem (allowing all smart devices worldwide to communicate and transact securely)\n* **Big-time partnerships** (Vanderbilt University, DoorDash, European Union, Gronk, Steve Aoki, etc., links below)  \n[https://news.yahoo.com/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html](https://news.yahoo.com/beyond-protocol-partners-vanderbilt-university-090000710.html)\n\n[https://worldredeye.com/2021/09/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan/](https://worldredeye.com/2021/09/beyond-protocol-presents-connected-athlete-featuring-rob-gronkowski-steve-aoki-charly-jordan/)  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-protocol-jonathan-manzi-gets-174811658.html)\n\n* **Plenty of funding** (vastly oversubscribed private sale, institutional investors including a Top 3 CEX in Huobi)\n\nDespite these key indicators for mass adoption being in place, \u201cretail crypto\u201d (i.e. most of us) really hasn\u2019t taken notice yet. This was also the case for Fantom and Solana until recently.  \nQuality projects first seek to build their tech, team, and partnerships\u2014first laying a strong foundation\u2014\\*then\\* market like hell; and that\u2019s exactly the road Beyond Protocol has taken. They\u2019ve built in \u201cstealth mode\u201d since 2018, and have since been laying the technological and marketing groundwork to a long-term crypto blue chip.  \nSo my message to you is simple\u2014get in early.  \nTheir mainnet launches in Q2 of 2022, but they have publicly shared plans to ramp up marketing to retail on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok\u2014we\u2019re talking big influencers, and the accompanying explainer videos, tweet threads, and memes.  \nTo be blunt, no matter how good your project is fundamentally, you need the marketing and retail FOMO to really get nice speculative price action\u2014and the team seems to know this, if the CEO\u2019s recent comments are any indication.  \nI\u2019ll conclude with a market cap comparison:  \nFantom in Jan 2021: $40 million  \nFantom in Nov 2021: $7 billion **(increase of 175x)**  \nSolana in Jan 2021: $100 million  \nSolana in Nov 2021: $70 billion **(increase of 700x)**  \n**Beyond Protocol in Nov 2021: $160 million**  \n\n\n**Beyond Protocol in Sept 2022: ???**  \nAlso worth noting\u2014the closest project they have to a competitor is **IOTA**, which currently checks in at a **$4 billion market cap**. Just looking at Beyond Protocol\u2019s tech, advisor team, industry connections, and marketing, I fully expect these guys to blow IOTA out of the water after mainnet.  \nAnother important thing to keep in mind here is the upcoming January 4th private sale unlock; presalers voted to delay initial vesting distributions until that date, and I\u2019d expect at least some downward price movement around then. That being said, the team has been in close communication with private sale holders, and is apparently arranging for OTC transactions for anyone who\u2019d like to sell any $BP in January, so I think current prices are still an excellent deal. Q4 marketing should push these levels up a good deal before the unlock as well.  \nEither way, these levels will look like nothing long-term.

SOL rewards are created out of thin air!\u201d**\n\nSolana is an ultra-fast blockchain supporting tens of thousands of transactions per second \u2014 at a fraction of the cost compared to Ethereum, for example.\n\nWhich is why 350+ projects have chosen to build on the Solana blockchain so far (https://solana.com/ecosystem); Serum alone produces a whopping $80M of transaction value daily.\n\nEvery transaction performed within any of these projects costs SOL, which ensures that SOL has an intrinsic value. Should everyone lose all trust in an arbitrary $sh\\*tcoin, it would plummet to 0 within an hour, since there is absolutely no value backing it. Should everyone suddenly lose trust in $SOL, it would only drop slightly as there is direct utility connected to it (which is what happened on September 14th; more on that below).\n\nYes, SOL suffers inflation of about 7% due to rewards accrued on all staked SOL.\n\nStill, its price goes up steadily \u2014 because this inflation is strongly outpaced by the rising demand ensured by the vast number of Solana-based projects, and also because there is well-warranted trust in a coin backed by the enormous utility of its issuing blockchain.\n\nNope, definitely not a Ponzi scheme.\n\nYou can take off that tin foil hat now.\n\n**Myth 2: Solana is not really decentralized or censorship-resistant!**\n\nThe infamous \u201cBut the network was shut down!\u201d argument.\n\nThe network cracked under pressure as the number of transactions per second exceeded 400,000 due to bot activity during an IDO on Raydium. Yes, the blockchain forked.\n\n80% of validators coordinated on Discord to shut the network down and restart it. It took 80% of the network\u2019s total stake to do that **because Solana is decentralized**, duh. Solana Foundation did not make the decision on their own and did not arbitrarily shut the network down. They simply don\u2019t have the authority.\n\nThe Solana code was also rapidly upgraded, and the upgrade confirmed by the consensus of validators, which means that such an event\u2013which was essentially a DDoS attack\u2013cannot repeat itself.\n\nThe ability of Validators to come together and restart the network\u2014or shut it down\u2014is in the definition of decentralization.\n\nRead a detailed report on the September 14th outage here: [https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview](https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview)\n\n**Myth 3: All of Solana\u2019s new validators are secretly run by people who already control older/larger validators; you can\u2019t afford to start a new validator as an outsider.**\n\nYes, it\u2019s a global, decentralized thing, so it\u2019s hard to keep track of who is running the delegators; of course there are so-called \u201csybils\u201d \u2014 smaller validators run by the owners of big validators.\n\nBut the idea behind Tour De Sol is to make it economically feasible for the \u201cnew guy\u201d to run a validator. Every participant needs to present identification and sign an agreement ensuring they are not running multiple nodes. It won\u2019t \\*guarantee\\* there are no \u201csybils\u201d in the TDS, but it surely helps.\n\nIt\u2019s probably worth mentioning at this stage that our 100% free tool,  \n[sv-manager](https://github.com/mfactory-lab/sv-manager) is there for anyone to help quickly bootstrap and run a Solana validator, with free support from our team and also from the community via Telegram group.

For an added bonus, Solana staking is non-custodial making it more secure than Ethereum's.  \n\nSure, Ethereum is meant to improve with sharding, but Vitalik has recently told people that sharding will take a long time and is guiding people towards Layer 2 solutions.

It happened, they had to acknowledge it and made efforts to balance it out. I read the Medium article, look it up if interested (sorry I'm posting on my mobile it's too much work to post links lol). Not many chains are born perfect, and one mistake shouldn't define it.\n\n*2. Decentralization -* Solana mainnet launched in March 2020. In a year or so, it is already more decentralized than many other chains, even with the high cost of being a validator at this point. If one expects a chain to be so decentralized within such a time frame, it is unrealistic. In fact AVAX has done a great job in this matter, launching later but already having more validators and a higher Nakamoto Coefficient. Im going to buy some AVAX after this. In fact, if one skimmed through a few of the explorers for the different chains, you'd actually see Solana Beach being transparent and stating how many validators can theoretically halt the network, whereas most don't. That's transparency. \n\n*3. Broke down this year -* Again no chain is perfect. From what I read, even ETH had a similar problem in the early days (please correct me of I am mistaken). The rate of adoption Solana has gone through, it was impressive that it held up. They have since patched the issue. \n\n*4. VC chain -* This is by far the most absurd FUD narrative IMO. If you are a VC, and yes you are currently sitting on massive gains already, would you dump? I'd only dump if I knew the project was done for in the near horizon. The amount of new projects and initiatives being worked on and announced on the recent Breakpoint event says otherwise. And if you are an investor, you'd take your profits to reinvest at something that may make you more money. Crypto projects are probably one of the most important and potential money making projects RN, and Solana definitely tops that list in terms of growth. Why take your money out when all signs show to more growth on your investment?\n\nIm sorry if there are no links etc, but I'd just like to share my POV and I do not think what is shared is misleading. I have more ETH in $ than SOL, but I am not blind to what is happening. \n\nTribalism in crypto is a waste of time and a zero sum game. I believe in a multi-chain world, with new tech pushing the space and even older chains like ETH to better heights. I use Metamask, but I can't lie, once you start using Phantom there is no turning back. Everything is so snappy and the UI looks sick AF, esp that I can view my NFTs in my wallet itself.\n\nAlso, even if SOL starts to dump, you can always just start selling and buy into ETH, something else or even vice versa. It's not like once you buy into a crypto project you are stuck with it. Only those who want to pump their bags / are salty / or want to get in at lower prices (lol) spread FUD. \n\nSOL is a great project, it is growing so fast and the best part is that it's barrier to entry into its ecosystem is so low even new crypto plebs can enjoy them. This cannot be said of ETH atm with its gas fees. L2's are not for newbies just yet. Other new L1's are also competing and doing really well, but SOL has a big investment behind it and will likely thrive first. Most devs need to earn to live too, and being part of Solana will likely ensure that earning a living won't be an issue. \n\nSo if one still prefers to FUD over SOL and deny it's credibilty, it is likely (at this point in time) that he/she will get left behind. \n\nSo go get some SOL, get some ETH, defo some BTC and I think maybe some AVAX too (not financial advice lol). \n\nThank you for coming to my first ever reddit post.

I got called a shill and told I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s up almost 300% since then. I\u2019m going to try and explain it again.So I\u2019m always trying to follow the DYOR advice that everyone rightfully spouts here and I think I get why Solana is being treated as a potential Next Big Coin. I\u2019m going to try and summarize the things I\u2019ve learned so hopefully you won\u2019t have to do as much thinking to understand it if you do your own research. Additionally, I hope this will explain why I\u2019m bullish on SOL.\n\n#Part 1:  The Byzantine Generals Problem is one all blockchains must solve\n\nThe Byzantine generals problem goes like this\n\n1. The army of Byzantium is huge and led by a proportionate few generals who each lead vast legions (the users of the blockchain and their validators)\n\n2. The generals all have to agree on a tactic for the army to be effective (the validators must validate a block before it gets added to the chain)\n\n3. Generals communicate through messengers (we assume the messengers themselves always follow orders, as here they represent digital signals)\n\n4. Some generals are traitors and send bad plans to the network (bad validators, possible 51% attackers)\n\n5. How do all the generals know when a general is trustworthy? (We need a consensus protocol)\n\n6. The tactic that most generals agree with is the one which will help Byzantium (the network democratically decides the movement of the blockchain) \n\nThis is where all blockchains agree: something must be done. There are different strategies to get this done but they all have to consider what happens when the network is huge, what happens when there are a lot of potential traitors, and how to keep the army efficient as possible in its actions without letting it get bogged down in security validation.\n\nI think Solana\u2019s approach is novel and robust.\n\n#Part 2: Proof of History resolves the dilemma between pure Proof of Work and pure Proof of Stake \n\nBitcoin\u2019s revolutionary consensus protocol, Proof of Work or Nakamoto Consensus, objectively secures the blockchain through hard mathematics applied to deterministic physics. Basically, people compete to do math in a way that can\u2019t be shortcut until they get the chance to validate the new block. However, as people have pointed out, this is inevitably energy-draining. Energy use is **not** inherently immoral, as some FUDers would have you believe, but it is a real logistic concern in a world that is running out of time to stop dumping energy into carbon emitting things. Thus you see the investment into non-saleable renewables, like geothermal and hydroelectric energy, being diverted towards Bitcoin\u2019s massive energy requirements. In an ideal system, we\u2019d have fusion and all energy would be free, but we\u2019re not there yet so we have to work with what we have.\n\nEthereum is switching from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake consensus, which uses game theory to validate the network. The idea is that if your generals materially depend on the army, through investment of their resources in its stability, they will be the least likely to betray the system.  This is clever, as it banks on humans being selfish dicks overall (which we are, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s okay as long as it\u2019s not hurting anyone) and doesn\u2019t need great energy consumption, but it\u2019s **normative** security, determined by people, not **objective** security, determined by math and physics.\n\nSolana combines staking with Proof of History. Proof of History is a consensus protocol where the output of the encryption function relates directly to how many times the function has been called, and the output can\u2019t be retrieved without having called the function that many times with the exact same input beforehand. Additionally, unlike Cardano and other would-be ETH killers, ***Solana already has smart contracts and NFTs.***\n\n#Part 3: A dumbed down example of Proof of History\n\nIt helps me to understand consensus protocols if I can see an example of what\u2019s happening.\n\nLet\u2019s say we have three transactions. They\u2019re encrypted so we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in them, but let\u2019s call them A, B, and C. I call them this because that lets you retain their transaction order, first A, then B, then C.\n\nSolana passes each of these transactions in order through its consensus protocol, PoH. PoH takes as input the transaction and internal clock that objectively measures the order of transactions, so it goes:\n\nPoH(A, timestep 0) \u2014&gt; hash: encrypted version of A at timestep 0   \n\nPoH(B, timestep 1) \u2014&gt; hash: encrypted version of B at timestep 1   \nPoH(C, timestep 2) \u2014&gt; hash: encrypted version of C at timestep 2  \n\nThis provides an objective measure of not only **that** each transaction has happened, but ***when*** each transaction happened in order.  If transaction B were input at timestep 0, the ***entire blockchain would be affected.*** This is an **objectively secure** function that cleans up transaction order without relying on humans and game theory to work. Aliens couldn\u2019t crack it no matter how powerful and godlike their tech and understanding was; it\u2019s simply the laws of physics at work.\n\n#Conclusion: Solana outperforms the big boys in the ways that matter\n\nLet\u2019s put aside the conceptual math and just look at numbers. We\u2019re going to be looking at **transactions per second** (TPS) and average fees.\n\n[Visa manages 1.7k transactions per second for credit cards with a processing fee of 1.43-2.4%](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-credit-card-processing-fees-costs) (Visa claims it can tolerate up to 56k tps, but this hasn\u2019t been stress tested)\n\n[Bitcoin manages 5-7(0.005k-0.007k)  TPS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/transactions-per-second-tps) with an [average fee of ~$3 USD.](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee)\n\n[Ethereum currently manages ~30 TPS](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ethereum-going-green-ether-crypto-carbon-footprint/) with an [average fee of $2.50 USD ](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) Vitalik himself claims that this will be boosted to up to 100k TPS with sharding and other strategies rolled into ETH2.0, but this is purely theoretical until it\u2019s real. \n\n[Solana manages ~59k TPS with a theoretical upper bound of 710k TPS](https://twitter.com/ByteSizeCapital/status/992651322695413760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E992651322695413760%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsolana.blog%2Fseriously-how-fast-can-solana-blockchain-get%2F) and [an average tx fee of $0.00025 USD.](https://solberginvest.com/blog/how-much-are-solana-fees/ ) Naturally, these fees are paid in SOL and they\u2019re congestion-based like ETH, so even if SOL reaches BTC levels of market cap or price, its fees will still be a fraction of a dollar.\n\nAll this, with smart contracts.\n\n#tl;dr: 5 reasons why me like SOL money\n\n\n1. Money fast (TPS greater than BTC and ETH by orders of magnitude)  \n2. Money secure (PoH is objective and staking further insures the network against bad actors)  \n3. Money easy (the energetic requirements of Solana are vastly lower than the major L1 chains)   \n4. Money cheap (tx fees sub dollar for the foreseeable future no matter how huge the network gets)  \n5. Money useful (Smart contracts are already live)\n\nSOL money good.

There were dozens of posts in this subreddit claiming that SOL is about to die and that its run was over!\n\nHowever now after a few red days, SOL is almost 15% up since yesterday. There are many upcoming conferences. Whales are jumping in. Companies are building on Solana because it is fast and cheap.

Full disclosure, I do hold some ETH, but I hold no ADA or SOL\n\nEthereum's goals are very ambitious. It is very very expensive to use at the moment, but if the devs can deliver on promises it could be the crypto that the prophecies foresaw. Decentralized and highly secure at all costs with high throughput for a reasonable fee. It has the first two currently. Ethereum clearly has the first mover advantage and a recognized name industry-wide. Second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum plans to move to PoS where each validator needs to put up their own collateral so they have a meaningful downside if they act maliciously. Ethereum has been criticized for it's astronomical fees, it's unwillingness to alleviate those fees if it means sacrificing decentralization even a little and it's slow time to make progress and code upgrade delays.\n\nCardano is an academic research project that relies on a variant of dPoS called Oroboros for security. It improves on the dPoS protocol by allowing any number of validators which eliminates some of the drawbacks of dPoS vs PoS. Delegation separates the voting power of a validator from the amount they personally hold and gives them voting power equal to the coins of those who delegate to them. It requires a level of trust of those staking to those validating. This isn't inherently bad and dPoS can still be very secure, but removing the need for trust is one of the pillars of Blockchain. Cardano aims to be the blockchain for mission critical applications. It's coding language Haskell is peer reviewed and used academically for secure applications. Haskell has been criticized as a language for being a pain to code in for most applications. The cardano team had been criticized for taking too long to deliver on promises. That is a theme in the crypto realm, but cardano seems to be taking longer than others.\n\nSolana's goals are scalability above all else. Sacrificing decentralization to get there. It can currently run at mind-boggling speeds that make others look like dial up compared to fiber. However, not just anyone can spin up a node and participate in securing the network. The computing costs are quite high. Server-grade hardware is all but required and internet speeds that are not even available for most consumers (300M upload minimum, 1G upload recommended). Solana has a PoH (proof of history) consensus mechanism, which is really a different modified PoS system. Solana found a way to agree on the order of transactions amongst it's nodes rather than relying on who pays the highest fee like what most validators use to determine the next block. What I find the most interesting about Solana is that if a validator gets slashed for acting maliciously, all those delegating to them also get slashed. This may seem like a scary thing for users, but it's actually really good for the network to have downside risk. It forces users to carefully evaluate validators before delegating. However, the outrageous costs of running a validator prohibit most users from spinning up their own validator instead. Solana has been criticized for being too centralized (which really is the point of cryptocurrency.- why bother using one if you can just use a centralized AWS and have better performance?). They don't have a specific goal of lowering requirements either since that is what allows the network to move so fast. Solana has also been criticized for having some potentially shady business practices and \"forgetting to inform\"  (read: \"lying to\") the community. \n\nTLDR\n\nIn short, Ethereum's goal is to be like the internet (used by everyone, owned by no one). Cardano's goal is to be like the data layer for Ivy league schools, government, etc (mission critical and academic, but more purpose built than general use) and Solana's goal is to be like Google, FB and Amazon (fast, used by everyone for free, but centralized and you probably don't really love the people running it)\n\nPlease let me know if you disagree with anything or feel so withing should be elaborated.

We'd also be able to mint more lower-value game items as well instead of only being able to exclusively cater to \"the rich\" that can afford expensive NFTs and gas fees.\n\nThe goal would be to not have to support both chains so I would imagine it to be a one-way bridge (ETH tokens probably would get burnt). The tokens that aren't bridged would still be tradable on Ethereum, but the in-game benefits may eventually be lost if we discontinue support for ETH. If we eventually drop bridge support, the unbridged tokens would just not be available on Solana (essentially considered burnt).\n\nWe believe the lower fees would be a game changer opening up a lot more possibilities, utility, and user freedom.

But there is another hidden gem in this ecosystem I believe. A low-cap meme coin with a 17.7 Billion maximum circulating supply that has been 100% distributed, has fantastic distribution with the #1 wallet containing 6% of the supply and belonging to the creator, has already had 2 major pumps yet consolidated back to VERY favorable levels with strong support and volume, has a baked in fun culture from having been created by a member of the Panda Street NFT community, 20% of the original supply was part of a liquidity pool at release and has since been burned rendering the coin utterly rug proof. I can go on, but I'd rather leave it to another hodler who recently made this post on our brand new subreddit, I think it does a good job of breaking down the coin's 3 week history. The coin I think you all should look very seriously at is Bamboo Coin ($BMBO)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 Days ago I wrote a piece on whether $BMBO was still bullish (below link). Today I am here to update my views on the subject\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/BambooCoin/comments/qx9hej/are\\_we\\_bullish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambooCoin/comments/qx9hej/are_we_bullish/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the last 4 days $BMBO has seen price volatility between 58 points to 115 points and is now continuing consolidation at around 65 - 70 points as I write this article. Comparing price from 4 days ago BMBO is currently sitting at 3.08% gains over the last 4 days.\n\nFor people looking for instant gains this may not seem very positive but in my opinion it is very positive when you look at the market results over the last 4 days. The attached table provides a snapshot of coins of interest to attempt to compare $BMBO against the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets break this down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTC is sitting at a 0.72% increase over this timeframe and has sucked the life out of a number of coins in its volatility\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly 1 Large Cap (I am a LUNA perma bull so I like to add it in) has seen greater increase in price then $BMBO and that is $SOL. For those who aren't fully across $BMBO. Solana is the ecosystem it is built on. So bullish signs for $SOL shows bullish signs for $SOL coins in my opinion. It is anticipated that $SOL profits trickle down to its ecosystem in time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll Tier 1 Meme coins have seen worse results then BMBO over the last 4 days\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$SOL meme coins with larger communities and Market Caps have seen significant decreases in price over the last 4 days\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen assessing the table it seems simple to me. Bamboo Coin has shown strength in a weak part of the market when coins 10x - 10,000x its Market cap showed weakness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis then leads me to my number 1 question. Are we still in a $BTC and crypto bull market? If we are and this is a shakeout, then a $1mil MC showing this strength shows huge potential for massive gains when we finish this correction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still believe we are in a we still in a $BTC and crypto bull market and this is a correction.

Please share your reasoning along w your choices. \n\nLimited to assets commonly available in the US. This is a discussion about long term plays. Not interested in quick pumps or reckless gambling. \n\nI\u2019ve determined that this list (along with ETH) have strong cases for support. I\u2019d love to hear from the community about their research, beliefs, and projections. Please include your thoughts and encourage discussion!\n\nI\u2019m genuinely interested in disruptive, innovative technology. I invested in TSLA, MRNA, and big tech like BABA and Amazon. I just never went in hard enough to make life changing gains. Now, with more financial security, I want to put some weight behind the projects with the best long term potential. \n\nMy brief thoughts:\n\nADA: Hoskinson, PoS, interesting prospects for smart contracts and DApps. I like that it was designed to solve business challenges and not necessarily \u201cfor the cause\u201d. Downside, trading down past month, hasn\u2019t really broken open in functional uses.\n\nAMP: Cheap entry point, novel solution concept, could grow 4-5x. Downside, the team clearly doesn\u2019t know how to sell the real world usage opportunities, probably never going to be a $1 token. \n\nALGO: Silvio Micali is a Touring award winning professor who is an expert in most things I don\u2019t understand. Can easily gain interest, PoS, cheap to buy, will almost certainly double in value, could be a real foundational part of the future of finance. Downside, trading sideways at a slight decrease for a bit, website hurts my eyes, probably not a 10x gain from here on. \n\nDOT: Gavin Wood, PoS, has some buzz after posting all time highs, some projections have it 2, 3, 4, even 5x from here. Focus on solving actual problems, scalability, no forks. Better web and marketing than some. Is this really Web 3.0 tech? Downside, pricey compared to some other options, could be buying at the top, hard to change the world. \n\nLRC: Layer 2 solution to some of Ethereum\u2019s big problems. Price predictions on this are not great, but some say 3x in 5 yrs and maybe even as high as $10 down the road. Now, if the GME thing happens and retail investors from WSB pile on, it could spike quite dramatically. Faster, cheaper transactions than pushing to ETH directly. Downside: could be a disaster, could be buying near the ATH right now, homepage of website sucks, price spiked but is retracting, now with majority Sell sentiment. \n\nMANA: Crazy ride over the past week and month. I\u2019m too old to understand what Decentraland is\u2026 as are many heavy investors and institutions, which could turn them completely off from investing in MANA. Or, we could be looking at the beginning of all those near-future movies where people prefer the virtual world to the real one. Could be a 3x return in 12-18 months, or could zero out. Idfk \n\nMATIC: as stated on their site \u201csolves pain points associated with Blockchains, like high gas fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing security.\u201d Sounds great to me. A bit mediocre this week w a balanced buy:sell ratio. Since its spike in price, could be buying near the top. Could be worth $10 in 5 years, could be worth $100 in 20 yrs\u2026 or could drop 50% next month, or worse - zero out because if Ethereum isn\u2019t the future, neither is MATIC. \n\nSOL: Pricey compared to some others. Competitor of Ethereum, faster and cheaper. Cool website, like their video, nice marketing. Built to solve real problems. Rapidly growing. 2x growth likely. 3x in 5 years? Probably more. Lots of bulls here. Other than the fact that ETH is just so much more powerful in the market right now, I don\u2019t see a lot of downside to SOL (I actually bought 4 more while I wrote this). \n\nXLM: the Stellar concept is fascinating. Could it be the future of global commerce and finance? I love the idea that it can focus on developing economies and how it performs forex exchanges. But what is the benefit of XLM itself on the Stellar network if you can use essentially anything on it? Almost dead after a horrific 90% plummet a couple of years ago. It could double in a month or it could once again lose almost everything. Could it be a $2 asset in 5 years? If it\u2019s a 5x return in 5 years, great. From what I understand, As long as Ripple is engaged w the SEC, XRP remains suppressed so XLM has room to breathe. \n\nEDIT: Please include some of your reasoning along with your 3, and if you respect the research into each of these, please throw the homie some love. \n\nMy current positions: Total crypto portfolio a little over (edit: removed value as suggested)\n\nI hold a little of all of these, a decent amount of DOGE, and a handful of ETH. \n\nNo BTC at all because of a psychological block on buying so high.

Earlier this year they released the triple IDO (Initial Decentralized  Offer) which sent this network and Atlas, the in-game currency and  POLIS, the governing token around 150 times higher. But star atlas has  much more potential. Star Atlas can be described as a combination of NFT with the gaming industry using the concept of the  metaverse.  \nThe idea is to monetize the time spent playing the game. Gamers can collect NFT\u2019s and sell them for real cash in the Star  Atlas marketplace. This ecosystem comes with a deflationary mechanism,  by losing your NFT spaceships if you engage and lose in a battle. 80% of  the Atlas tokens will be rewarded to successful players, while after  selling 20% of the Polis coins, the rest will be distributed to the DAO.

It has the highest  TVL (Total Value Locked) on Solana with $12.6 billion. What makes  Radium stand aside is the fact that the other DEX and DeFi  (Decentralized Finance) suffer from two main issues: one, most exchanges  are based on the Ethereum network which means network congestion and  high gas fees, and two, and they can access liquidity only within their  pools.  \nRaydium can overcome these challenges by incorporating  Serum on the Solana blockchain, which is the first AMM (Automated Market  Maker) that optimizes the speed of the Solana network and the DEX limit  order book, meaning endless liquidity supply, friction less yield  farming and speed token swaps. With the Serum connection from Raydium,  the whole Solana Ecosystem gets access to more liquidity. The average  all-time high ROI for the IDO is at 5,000%, while RAY which is the  native token has had a great performance in recent months.\n* ORCA  \nORCA  is a DEX where the TVL has exploded recently, reaching $1.11 billion.  It is a pure AMM DEX on Solana, which encourages users to:  \n\n* **Swap**  \u2013 Orca users can use its own pool and unlike Raydium and does not use  Serum as a source of liquidity and they can tap on liquidity pools as  well.

Or perhaps...Scuttle priority?\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/gp7w39o8a4k71.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bdecef12ff31f11a6315904eab30ddd304d6d74)\n\nUpdated bio: Aurelion was once a space dragon who dreamed of becoming a maid. One day, she met Pantheon of the Aspects. She decided to become Pantheon's maid. Pantheon said OK. The end.\n\nEssentially, this is a VGU that changes ASol's character model to an anime girl. The same is done for all his/her skins. Her abilities are also updated, to better fulfill the fantasies of being a space dragon maid. Below is a very rough draft of what her kit might look like (subject to further balancing):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHP PER LEVEL: ~~92~~ => 110\n\n**Q:** Base damage: ~~70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230~~ \u21d2 70 / 105 / 140 / 175 / 210\n\nNEW: Q gains 10% damage for every 1000 units it travels. Thus, the larger the galaxy formed, the more damage it does.\n\n**W:** Reverted to being a toggle.\n\n**E:** Mana cost: ~~60~~ \u21d2 200.\n\n**R:** Unchanged.\n\nOverall, Q and W are intended to be power-neutral. E is intended to be a nerf, and her HP growth is meant to be a buff. The idea is to nerf her early-game (pre-mana Mythic) map impact, while buffing her durability as a battlemage. Early on, she can shove with W or roam with E, but she can no longer shove with W AND roam with E, due to mana issues. Post-laning phase, she should be free to roam as she pleases, like before. And then the Q change is just because big galaxy explosions are fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA model update to Aurelion Sol, combined with the appropriate kit change, can potentially boost his/her play-rate by over ten times, all the way up to 5%.

Items of note:\n\n-the Sundaeswap team determined that the entire Cardano chain, without any other dApps competing for resources, will have slower **PEAK** tx speeds than half the **AVERAGE** tx rate used by one dApp on ethereum. They compared cardano's peak to the average rate on Uniswap v3 (but didn't count v2). Cardano will have options to speed that up in the future, but they are not ready yet (see second link below). And even then, cardano will still be slower than ETH, the slowest layer one chain that anyone has ever heard of. [See u/grimmergrimmergrime 's comment for an estimate of v2's speed: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qnjmby/cardano_is_coasting_into_an_iceberg_the_crew_are/hjhhfz5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3 ] SS swap claims a theoretical max tpm of 3800 is \"impressive.\" 3800 tpm is an unverified max, and it is INCREDIBLY slow for a L1. For example, it's about 160x slower than Cosmos' max tpm. \n\n-They accurately explain why all the other proposed solutions create vulnerabilities, weaknesses, market inefficiency, attack vectors and centralization that Uniswap type AMMs do not have\n\n-They propose to add a novel, gated and \"trusted\" application-specific proof of stake layer with untested incentives (and untestable due to the lack of direct fee incentives on a testnet). They have determined that the best way to avoid the UTXO concurrency dilemma is to appoint third party aggregators to execute all of the orders, and \"[t]he first step is choosing trusted members of the community to run them.\" So much for having the most decentralized chain. \n\n-They rate every solution to this problem, including their own, as requiring more development work and creating more \"surface area [that] needs to be audited\" than Uniswap.

I'll admit my bias for the project, but my opinions have not been formed based on rampant, baseless speculation. Let's look at the facts and the data. I believe I've been able to leave my bias out of most everything below...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Here is the Messari table for most active coins](https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B)\n\nYou can sort this table in all sorts of ways. As of today, if you sort by \"Real Volume\", \"Transaction Volume\", or \"Adjusted Transaction Volume\", you'd see Cardano ranked 3rd behind BTC and ETH. Now, some will refute this evidence of Cardano's utility by saying that Messari skews these numbers for UTxO platforms because of \"change\" UTxOs. Fair enough...let's sort by \"Active Addresses\" and we see Cardano ranked 4th at ~383k addresses, 80% of ETHs active addresses and about 42% of BTC...and this is without any DeFi projects having launched yet. You can see [here](https://messari.io/charts/cardano/act-addr-cnt) that is a growth of about 250% over the last week.\nTheDeFi project with the biggest reputation at this point, SundaeSwap, will most likely launch before the end of the year. People LOVE to measure the value of a chain based on TVL, which many Cardano bears will correctly state that there is currently zero TVL. Yeah, no shit...you can't measure something before it's been created. It's like trying to say somebody will be a shit athlete before they're even born, they have to at least grow to an age where they can start participating (analogies not always my strong suit, bare with me...). Anybody calling Cardano \"vaporware\" is lying, and anyone saying it \"has no dapps yet\" is not paying attention to the activity in the community and, while true at THIS VERY MOMENT, is basically ignoring the state of current DeFi projects. Ethereum took far longer than 11 weeks for good quality dapps to get going, Cardano will have them in about 4 months time from launch of smart contracts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk...so Cardano is being used A LOT right now...how is it handling the load? Well, you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_59kxcdtwnc) that the blockchain load has been steadily increasing since October. And you can see [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/s0XCC) that the number of transactions is spiking greatly. (You can adjust the graphs to an earlier date to see that the trend is increasing but I can't link directly to it). Best thing about Cardano? It was built to BEND NOT BREAK!!! There are many parameters that can be adjusted on an epoch's notice to accommodate more transaction volume. In fact, [that is exactly what is being done](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/). At the moment this is controlled by IOG, but when we eventually get full on-chain governance we, the community, will be in control of how Cardano adapts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm hoping I've laid out the facts with evidence pretty clearly here and I think I've avoided bias.

Do you really think anything changed?The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nI personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.\n\nUnless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to \"Cardano killing Ethereum\". Hint: they'll never migrate.\n\nI'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.\n\nTo all of the people about to yell at me for making another \"Cardano is overhyped post\" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about \"Ethereum killers\" and how \"great\" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?\n\nWhere is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same \"academic scientific approach\" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.\n\n!remindme 8 months\n\nEDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide \"technical\" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.\n\nEDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar \"pump, dump, pump\" related to the smart contract release, but the \"pump\" following the \"dump\" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't \"kill everything in this space\", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.\n\nEDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to \"FUD\" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.\n\nThe point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar \"Ethereum killing\" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.\n\nEDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:\n\n>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  \n>  \n>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  \n>  \n>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.\n\nEDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of \"missing\" Cardano or \"buying it high\" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).\n\nEDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.\n\nThis isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.\n\nJust want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!\n\nEDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!\n\nEDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.\n\nThanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!\n\ntl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product.

Looks like someone has had the *bright* idea of creating a memecoin on cardano. In my opinion we don't need any of that, but that's not just for me to decide. If people want memecoins, then memecoins they will probably have. \n\nThe problem with this however, is that this is not how any project is supposed to work. They created r/bisoncoincardano where you can read what they are all about. \n\nI quote:\n>We minted 300.000.000 BISCOIN ***(three hundred million BisonCoins).***Currently there are still 299.997.000 BISCOIN available due to the fact that we made the first donation to the project where we minted the tokens... as a \"token of gratitude\" for all the help they provided. \n\n>ICO Value: \n\n>\u20b3 0.50 / per token (02:00am October 31st 2021) \n\n>ADA only.

For every ADA we receive... we will send the equivalent in BisonCoins to the sender. That's it! \n\n\nThis raises one MASSIVE red flag, trust. Cryptocurrency is built for trustless transactions, this is just like one of those you give us 1 ada, we will give you 2 ada back scams. If you create a token, you don't get to play exchange by manually transferring tokens, this is not how this is supposed to work. \n\nIf this is not a scam, it's just made by people who have no idea what they are doing, which is just as good of a reason not to invest.

Also the AMA was from October 30th, 2021, not October 31st, 2021 like it says in the title. \n\nThis is not a 100% accurate transcription and it is not complete. I tried to summarize some of the more interesting notes from the most recent AMA Charles did. If I quote something, I tried to get it right, but I may have misspelled something or misheard, so I do not guarantee perfect accuracy here. Anyway, I think I got the gist of it. I tried to keep it focused on questions that were about the state of Cardano, the vision for scaling Cardano, digital economics. I didn't focus on more personal or off-topic stuff. There's a long discussion about Shiba Inu, Doge coin, and I didn't feel like taking notes on this. \n\n**General State of the Union**\n\n* Alonzo Hard Fork September launch was a great success, and October was about adding in a lot of features.\n* Final stages of a Plutus application back-end (PAB). Transitioning from low-level Assembly language of Plutus to high-level applications like Sundae Swap and Meld are going to start deploying soon. Estimates PAB to go live, best estimate around November, but stuff happens.\n* Babbage hard fork between November 2021 and February 2022 - going to be a boatload of changes and optimizations. Basically the first wave was about correctness, and now they are going to focus on optimizations for scalability and real-world deployment. There is a layered execution strategy with Cardano.\n* John Woods (lead technical architect of Cardano, https://ie.linkedin.com/in/johnalanwoods) is focused for the next 6 months on optimization of performance, more throughput and scaling up systems parameters. Specifics are things like \u201ck\u201d, the blocksize, reducing the memory footprint (perhaps by 50%), how the data structures work in the system, UTXO-HD (hybrid storage of memory and hard drive), script compression. \n* Other parties are going to come in and optimize the Haskell code. Everything was first written for correctness, now they are focusing on optimization and scalability. \n* Another layer of workstream is Mithril (https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/). Light client solution with full node security. \n* Another layer is improving the performance of Daedalus and also adding in light client support on the IOHK end. As well as improving the light client ecosystem. \n* One of the most anticipated is the Hydra workstream. Goal is to have something by Q1 (first quarter of 2022?) that is a good beta, that can be attached to commercial partners like DEXes to see how one can offload traffic onto the Hydra Network for payments and for smart contracts. \n* Mamba - hoping for something developers can experiment with as early as January. Mamba adds in EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) support. \n* Yet another thread is standards for verifying smart contracts and their correctness. \n* Digital Identity - full prism integration into Cardano stack. This has been underway due to the Ministry of Education deal, the Boost mobile deal, etc. \n* The dApp store is another thread that is going on, so on and so forth. \n* 300-400 people are working on all of these things. \n* IOHK foundation announced a $25 million budget for 2022.\n* EMURGO (https://emurgo.io/) is trying to launch at least a $100 million fund that is Africa focused to start building out an ecosystem there.\n* Catalyst - 150 proposals were funded in the 6th round, largest one yet. $8 million Fund 7 starting in November. \n* A lot of social media criticism regarding the price. There\u2019s usually a big buildup and a big drawoff. Charles says he doesn\u2019t care and isn\u2019t focused on that. Charles doesn't understand market swings, and stays focused on technical development. \n* \u201cEvery single metric of Cardano is looking real strong.\u201d\n* Africa tour - overwhelming demand in e-governance and identity. \n* Met up with a lot of startup accelerators that want to build up on Cardano.\n* Anticipates dozens of deals coming from this Africa tour. The bottleneck is not having enough bandwidth to handle everything. \n* Zanzibar is launching a nation scale ISP with Cardano at the bedrock of it that will cover 1.8 million people. Expects a 12-to-24 month timeline in terms of rollout. Believes that what they do in Zanzibar will transfer over to many other nations. \n* People are already writing Solidity code that can be fueled and powered by Ada (mentions dcSpark - https://dcspark.io/).\n* Over last 2 months - tens of thousands of NFTs been issued. \n\n**ERC-20 Cardano Converter**\n\n* SingularityNet is in the process of migration\n* Two targets for ERC-20: one is the main chain, the other is Mamba \n* More resources will be invested in the ERC-20 team\n* ERC-20 to native asset standard, first example of this is going to be Singularity Net. This will be a case-study and they will work backwards to a more generic framework for it. \n* Long-term goal is automation and bridging, moving and wrapping assets.\n* Commercial tool that allows people to migrate to Cardano ecosystem, and there is a collection of competencies there. \n\n\n**Hydra**\n\n* Huge amount of work is going into Hydra\n* High commercial priority. Important that they can offload the traffic onto Hydra.\n* You need to segregate the traffic for microtransactions. \n* But still a bit of research going on, but converging to a good idea of a \u201c1.0\u201d \n\n**DJED**\n\n* A project by COTI, not technically from IOHK.\n* IOHK philosophy is to develop something, open-source it, and let other people develop their own competing implementations of it. \n\n**New light wallet from IOG**\n\n* Very high priority\n* Mithril will launch with light wallet, so you get full node security with it\n\n**FUD about increasing block size doesn\u2019t really increase amount of plutus smart contract per block**\n\n* Charles says this is a lie. If you increase the amount of storage a block has, you can of course increase the amount of scripts in that block. There are some limitations about amount of computation per block, but it\u2019s a very complex situation. For what it is worth, IOHK wrote a blog post about this: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/. \n* Seems like Charles big vision here is that the eUTXO model is massively parallelizable because there will be a massive amount of outsourcable computation: \u201c3-5 years into the future 99% of computing will be done off-chain, and checked with proofs on chain.\u201d\n* The scaling model: \u201cAs long as you have a proof that the out-sourcable computation was done correctly, that\u2019s all that matters and that\u2019s what checked on chain. You have a scarce resource on-chain, and unlimited, distributed resources off-chain. That\u2019s the model that makes sense.\u201d\n* \u201cYou\u2019re boiling the ocean if you are chasing global state.\u201d \n\n**How many transactions per second**\n\n* Average transaction (subjective what this means) of 50-100 per second for an average crypto you are doing okay for daily volume. Nice to get core chain to 500-1000 TPS. \n* Getting beyond 500-1000 for any sharded architecture is not going to happen. 50K TPS is centralizing or batching/rolling-up, effectively doing Layer Two (which is the spirit of Hydra). \n* Charles doesn\u2019t think there is a TPS problem. Or rather it\u2019s the wrong question, Charles thinks in terms of \u201cwhat is the off-chain, what is the on-chain?\u201d and how do you check correctness. \n* Charles thinks TPS is a useless in practice and is just a marketing metric. A dump-truck has 1000 horsepower, but it\u2019s completely different than a ~~coating stick (not sure about this transcription)~~ Koenigsegg (a sports car).\n\n**Paper wallet with staking capability**\n\n* Charles is very big on this one, it\u2019s a priority for him. \n\n**IOHK is not the ecosystem**\n\n* IOHK is independent from projects like Sundae Swap. Charles does not know the deadlines of all of these various projects. I guess he is getting flooded with these types of questions. \n\n**Coin burning**\n\n* Charles reiterates there will only ever be 45 billion ADA. Does not believe in modifying the monetary policy. No one can change it. \nCharles references when Stellar burned their reserve supply and it didn\u2019t do anything for the underlying price. \n\n**Plutus Dev Accreditation System**\n\n* Thinking about developing some sort of accreditation system \n* Hired 8 companies to just write a bunch of code for them. They also viewed these companies as training the trainers. \n* Continue to grow Plutus Pioneers program \n\n**Can hydra heads/channels talk with each other?**\n\n* Does it make sense to have everything go through the main chain or to have a synchronized Layer 2 setup? Charles believes in synchronized Layer 2 with Hydra.", {"entities": [[43, 50, "crypto"], [713, 720, "crypto"], [745, 752, "crypto"], [1640, 1647, "crypto"], [1691, 1698, "crypto"], [3143, 3150, "crypto"], [3968, 3975, "crypto"], [4137, 4144, "crypto"], [4323, 4330, "crypto"], [4721, 4728, "crypto"], [5217, 5224, "crypto"], [8235, 8238, "crypto"]]}], ["We should vote for Cardano!!! https://twitter.com/BitPay/status/1458977852230180868?s=20 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Let's vote!!](https://preview.redd.it/3ubdw8odhmz71.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0b8243641fe7cc31bf83f0af89233a75c6988a)", {"entities": [[19, 26, "crypto"]]}], ["Not the Cardano ada", {"entities": [[8, 15, "crypto"]]}], ["Which Cardano wallet do you recommend?

BUT I strongly believe though that for a project to become large and popular it needs to be attractive for developers to come build on top of. A platform that is unused regardless of its capabilities isn't worth much. With the recent post that is pro cardano I wanted to post about why I haven't utilized it for my side business I'm building on blockchain technology. I have cardano bags and keep it as a percentage of my portfolio, but I don't see it growing in amount of software project adoption anytime soon until they make it more attractive for developers to build on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm approaching this post as a software developer. This isn't meant to be a post on which projects promise or deliver x, y or z capabilities. Its meant to focus on how there are several chains applications can be built on, and how easy it is for a developer to go spin up a project on it. I strongly believe you can have the best block chain out there, but if it doesn't have a strong developer community it won't see use, and ultimately fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the software world its common to see university researchers come up with powerful projects but they ultimately don't get adopted by the general community of developers because they are built with obscure languages that no one uses. Cardano is deep with this problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen approaching which chain I wanted to build on I looked at a few things. These three bullets basically all center around the topic of how active is the developer community.\n\n* What language is used to build it?\n* How good is the developer community for answering questions. This is highly influenced by the above bullet. If its a common language then there will be a lot of online tutorials and documentation.\n* How many existing open source libraries are there for me to utilize. If I can avoid redesigning the wheel and focus on building the car it will save me time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets look at how Cardano answers these questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What language is used to build it?**\n\nCardano uses three languages. Its main one is Haskell. Haskell is known for being a researchers language. Its common in the university world but outside in the business world its very rare. Haskell is the #32 most commonly known language according to the stack overflow 2021 developer survey. \n\n* [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof)\n\nThen Cardano also uses Plutus and Marlow.

Why chose a chain that has this problem? There are plenty of chains that don't and you can hire developers who already know how to code in the language other block chains use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How good is the developer community for answering questions?**\n\nBy using obscure languages you can search on stack overflow. It isn't filled with any where as many answered questions as a common blockchain language like Solidity.\n\nGo on and search Haskell Cardano tutorials on [medium.com](https://medium.com). Now search for Solidity tutorials for ETH or AVAX. Rust + JS tutorials for DOT. C++ tutorials for SOL. \n\nThe list goes on but the other chains that I've looked at building on don't have this same issue Cardano has for ramping up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How many existing open source libraries are there for me to utilize?**\n\nNow I feel like I'm repeating myself, but the amount of code and prebuilt libraries out there for languages like Solidity, Rust, JS and C++ greatly outnumber those for Haskell. You're entering more of a no mans land where you will be some of the first smart contract builders in Haskell on Cardano. It will go slowly, and possibly be quite painful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the above is why on one hand I believe Cardano will deliver in the future all its promised. But who will utilize it? Its not friendly to build on, and I don't see why a business would chose an uphill battle to deliver their software. A lot of the crypto space are startups that have investors backing them. Investors want to see progress in the form of profit and deliverables. A startup needs to be fast and Cardano would be a poor choice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There is also the question of where do you move your software if the block chain you are on dies?** \n\nPlenty of posts looking at historic projects point out that the top coins often fall out, some don't even exist any more. The posts where the person buys the top 10 coins every January is a great example. If your software runs on Haskell on Cardano and Cardano dies in two years then you're a fish out of water. No other block chain can run that code. Other block chains that share languages don't have this issue because you can hop to the other projects if the one you're on dies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't meant to be a pro AVAX post but my partner and I went with AVAX back when it was \\~30-40 bucks a pop because it uses Solidity which ETH uses. We've been able to reutilize open source smart contract code from ETH projects which has greatly sped up our development cycles. The main reason we didn't go with ETH was the gas fees. The fact that both use Solidity makes it so if AVAX goes down we can move the logic to ETH or any other project running on Solidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat projects deliver for capabilities do not always align with what projects I'd want to build on as a developer. But for a project to survive it needs developers flocking to it. Cardano isn't it right now unfortunately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: When choosing which project to build software on I look at how easy it is, as well as what happens if the project dies.

Different projects have their own strategies. We will provide a basic overview. Then, we explain different points of view in this article with respect to the present and future of fees on Cardano. \n\n \n\n# Why fees are important\n\nThere is always a price to pay for good service. If you don\u2019t pay anything, the other party probably has some other benefits arising from the service. Perhaps these benefits are not obvious at first glance and the counterparty tries to keep them secret. Bank accounts and transactions used to be paid for. Today, bank customers in many countries do not pay the fees, or the price has gone down significantly. Public blockchain networks offer people an alternative financial system. To make this alternative user-friendly, the amount of fees is one of the deciding factors.\n\nYou can look at public blockchain networks, including Cardano, as a company with its own economic model. Cardano needs to have revenue in order to have expenses. Fees, along with coins that have yet to enter circulation through monetary expansion, are revenue. The Cardano network needs to pay for its security, decentralization, maintenance, and development. Cardano is a somewhat autonomous mechanism that behaves according to fixed rules that are embedded in the project\u2019s source code.\n\nThe Cardano network thus rewards pool operators and stakeholders who delegate ADA coins to pools according to the rules. A portion of the fees also goes to the project coffers for maintenance and development. The goal of the project is to build a functioning economy including governance and a strong community.\n\nWithout sufficient revenue, the lifespan of any blockchain project, as well as the company, would only be temporary. People are only willing to pay for useful services. Thus, these services must be accessible, cheap, fast, and reliable. The network must have a large network effect and be as good, if not better, than current centralized services. The only utility can ensure the profitability and thus the longevity of the network.\n\nCardano has a fixed number of ADA coins capped at 45,000,000,000. It is thus more dependent on fee collection than other networks with an inflationary model. The network can compensate for the lack of fees collected by infinite inflation. However, there is a risk that coins will lose value as their rarity decreases over time.\n\nThanks to inflation, there may even be networks where fees are not paid at all. Paying no fees is an attractive model for users, but probably hardly sustainable economically. The budget may one day run out, or inflation will be so high that coins will quickly lose value. Inflation may not cover the costs.\n\nFees are also important in terms of protecting the network from spamming with unnecessary transactions. If transactions are free, an attacker can generate a huge number of them and send them to himself. The network will be forced to process these transactions, which may be at the expense of other users\u2019 transactions. A large number of transactions may clog the network and the network may not be available. A solution may be to work with identity and limit the number of transactions per user. Alternatively, do a local Proof-of-Work before sending each transaction. This makes the attack costly.\n\nIt is important to remember that decentralization only works on the basis of economic incentives to behave fairly. If the network cannot afford the rewards, it cannot incentivize honest behavior. The number of rewards must be high enough to make it costly (ideally infeasible) to perform a 51% attack. If the network has free transactions, it is always a good idea to ask how security and decentralization are ensured.\n\nEvery public network needs to collect fees because it redistributes them to other people for useful work for the network.\n\n# What is a fair fee\n\nIt is very difficult to define a fair fee. In the first place, the fees collected should be sufficient to cover all the costs of the network. If the network does not have a budget for security or decentralization, it can be attacked and thus compromised. This must never happen.\n\nThe same amount of fees, say for example USD 1,000,000 per day, can be collected in different ways. The network can process 100,000 transactions for USD 10. Or 1,000,000 transactions for $1. Or even 10,000,000 for $0.1.\n\nThe last option is the most user-friendly. High fees are a usability killer and prevent adoption. In practice, we can see that people tend to migrate to competing networks with cheaper transactions. They will do so even if decentralization is lower. So it\u2019s not just about fair fees, but the competition across blockchain networks must be taken into account.\n\nThere is another catch regarding fees. 1 USD has a different value in different countries. In developing countries it\u2019s relatively high, in developed countries it is a high but acceptable fee. However, if you need to send 10 transactions a day, a total value for all transactions of $10 can be high even for people in rich countries. Networks should be accessible to all segments of the population, the poor, pensioners, and the poor.\n\nThe aim of each project is therefore to reduce fees to the minimum necessary. This has at least two key prerequisites. It must be technologically feasible and the network must have a high adoption rate. Demand for decentralized networks is relatively high and likely to grow. So the problem is more of a technological one. Specifically, we can talk about scalability.\n\nIt might be helpful if the fees could be set based on geographic information. Fees could then be lower in developing countries and higher in developed countries. However, this would introduce additional complexity into the whole solution, and perhaps it is only suitable for the second-layer solutions.\n\nIf we look at it from a market perspective, fair fees are those that people will be willing to pay. However, we run into another problem. It is difficult to predict the behavior and evolution of competitors. In a traditional environment, we often see that it is possible to subsidize service for a certain period of time in order to destroy the competition. It would be useful if the level of fees could be changed reactively, but this is not necessarily consistent with the desire for high decentralization. It seems that the way to succeed is to get a high network effect first, have cheap transactions, and have high added value.\n\n# It is all about resources\n\nIn the Cardano ecosystem, fees are mapped to consumed resources. Specifically, bytes in storage, bytes in RAM, seconds of CPU time, etc. They are also charged for the deposit of staking certificates, or the execution of Plutus scripts. If you look at it again as a company, you will see parallels. Normally you pay the costs associated with delivering the package, depositing the contract with a notary, or arranging the loan.\n\nOn-chain resources are limited (thus scarce) while demand is potentially unlimited. Difficulties arise when the demand for network usage is higher than the network capacity. The network must therefore have some mechanism to counteract the high demand. However, this defense is in most cases user-unfriendly.\n\nUsers want to get their transactions on the block as cheaply as possible. The throughput of the Cardano network, i.e. the number of transactions that the first layer can handle, is determined by the block size and block time. A Cardano block is 64KB at the time of writing. A typical transaction is something around 300B. At maximum, a transaction can have 16KB. So a block can hold about 200 normal-size transactions. For security reasons, the Cardano network currently produces about 1 block every 20 seconds. This means that the network can handle about 10 transactions per second.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that not only transactions are in the block, but also Plutus scripts. They will also take up some space, so there will be less space left for transactions. The size of a Plutus script is limited to 16KB.\n\nLet\u2019s try to explain it with the following analogy. Imagine a regular bus line (block size) between two cities that runs every hour (block time) and can carry 100 people. As long as fewer than 100 people use the line, it\u2019s not a problem. Once 120 people arrive at the stop, 20 people will have to wait for the next bus. If only 80 new people arrive on the next bus, the bus will take everyone and everything will return to normal. What if 200 people arrive in a rush? What if 150 people come every hour? The quality of service will decline. People\u2019s nervousness will increase. A solution will be sought. Some people will have to wait a few hours, maybe even days.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution to this? Get a bigger bus, run it more often, or limit the use of the service by, say, raising the fares.\n\nExactly the same can be done with block size and block time. The block size can be increased to accommodate more transactions. You can decrease the block time so that a new block is produced more often. However, even this has its limits.\n\nCardano is a decentralized network and it is not known in advance what pool will produce a new block. It is necessary for each new block to reach literally all nodes in the world before producing the next block. The more time there is to distribute the block, the better. The smaller the block, the better. At the time of writing, an increase in block size is being considered to increase throughput.\n\nPurely theoretically it is possible to increase the block size to 1MB and the block time to 1 second. This would result in a throughput of about 3000 transactions per second. However, it is questionable whether this is achievable in practice. The change of parameters will be gradual. The team will closely monitor the behavior of the network after slight incremental parameter changes. For example, if the network fails to propagate blocks in time, blockchain forks could occur frequently.\n\nIn economics, if demand rises, the price of a service can rise. If every bus is at capacity and people have to wait for the next one, fares can go up. This will discourage a few people from using the bus and they will prefer to drive their own car or take the train. More will be collected in fares. Is not it cool?\n\nThis solution is not ideal. If there is a high demand for a service, the aim should be to handle it and profit from it. This applies to both the transport service and the blockchain network. The question, however, is what to do if the limits of possibility are encountered. What to do if it is not technically possible to increase capacity? The fee market is one of the common solutions in the blockchain world.\n\n# The fee market\n\nFee market is used in Bitcoin. It is also used by Ethereum in a modified form (EIP-1559). Fee market, sometimes called an auction system, is used by pool operators when selecting transactions that are to be inserted into a new block. Transactions are selected based on the size of the transaction fees. The higher the fee, the more likely the pool is to include the transaction in a new block. The incentive, of course, is the financial reward that goes directly to the pool that adds its block to the blockchain.\n\nIf all new transactions can fit in the block at a given time, they are all included and none remain. However, if the network is currently being used a lot and there are more transactions available than can fit in the block, only those with the highest fees will be included. Thus, some of the transactions must wait to be included in the next round.\n\nAs a result, transactions can wait a long time for inclusion in the block. This is very inconvenient for the user. Moreover, if the network is clogged for a long time, people who want to send new transactions have to set a high fee. Theoretically a little higher than the lowest one in the last block. This gives the sender a chance that the fee will be higher than for older transactions that are still waiting to be sent. If a user sets a higher fee than the highest fee in the last added block, there is a good chance that his transaction will be included.\n\nThe annoying thing about the fee market is that users have to look at the current fees and set the appropriate fee based on how quickly they wish to send transactions. This extra step is very user-unfriendly. There are online calculators that can recommend the correct fee. Sometimes wallets do this. However, this is not ideal. People are basically speculating about the number of fees and are not sure when their transactions will be sent.\n\nAnother disadvantage of the fee market is that the fees are very volatile and unpredictable. If the blocks are empty, the fee can be relatively low. Let\u2019s say under a dollar. However, once traffic on the network increases, fees can get into the tens of dollars. The problem is that such large fees are significantly more expensive than those we know from the traditional world. Most people make transactions within their own country. These fees are very cheap, if not free. Cross-border transactions tend to be significantly more expensive, but most people don\u2019t need them. Blockchain networks don\u2019t distinguish between local and cross-border transactions and it doesn\u2019t matter if you are sending a small or large amount. You only pay for the network resources consumed.\n\nAnother disadvantage of the fee market, which I will mention only briefly, is the deliberate setting of high fees in order to rank faster ahead of competitors\u2019 transactions. Imagine a public auction of, say, a painting, where people can bid higher. If transactions are prioritized by the amount of the fee and not by the time of submission, it is possible to get the painting for a lower bid than the highest bid. How is this possible? A transaction with a lower bid but a higher fee will be ranked earlier, skipping transactions with a higher bid but a lower fee. Each auction ends at a given point in time and it is possible that the higher bid transactions will not make it to the block in time.\n\nThose interested in the painting sent their bid on time, but with a low fee. Or rather, they didn\u2019t count on being passed over for other transactions with lower bids just because of the fee. It seems that the fee market is only suitable for simple transactions where the time of sending is not critical. Alternatively, app developers need to find adequate defenses against this kind of attack.\n\n# Why is the fee market used?\n\nWe described the fee market and mentioned many disadvantages. So why is it used so often? The biggest advantage is that it works well when the network is clogged. That is when users send a large number of transactions and the network cannot process them all in time. The rising cost of fees reduces demand. People do not want to pay unnecessarily large fees, so they prefer to wait or use another network.\n\nThis advantage is also a disadvantage. At times of high network traffic, only those who can financially afford it can use the network. That is, mainly rich people. This makes the network exclusive, which is the opposite of what we want. Especially in the case of Cardano, where the team is trying to deliver a solution that will be inclusive especially for people from developing countries. Poor people cannot compete economically for network capacity. They need to have cheap transactions in the long term. It doesn\u2019t make sense for the price of charges to rise unexpectedly at a time when they need to pay on time for, say, their energy supply.\n\nFor the first layer, this is hardly a solvable problem. As we have already explained, first-layer resources will become increasingly scarce over time, and thus more costly to use. The only sensible solution is to make more use of second-layers. The scalability of the first layer can of course be improved. The IOG team will very likely succeed in increasing the first layer throughput by several orders of magnitude. However, it is a race against time, and estimating the adoption rate and development speed is very difficult.\n\nThe advantage of the fee market is that the price for transactions rises and falls with demand. This means that if the blocks are empty, the price of transactions naturally decreases. A small fee can be set and you are assured that your transaction will make it to the next block. Thus, there is no need to pay high, or fixed, fees at times when the network is less used. Let\u2019s also not forget that the native project coins themselves are very volatile. If the transaction price were defined fixed in native coins, it would rise and fall according to the mood of the markets. This situation is also not ideal.\n\nDemand may be high in the long term, in which case the price would essentially just rise and never fall to a reasonable level. In the extreme case, some transactions would never make it into the block and the network would have to discard them. This situation would likely lead to a loss of reputation for the network and less interest in using it. In the case of the Bitcoin network, some people expect first layer fees in the hundreds of dollars. Could it be thousands of dollars? It will depend on demand, which no one can predict.\n\nThe fee market has many disadvantages from our point of view, but it makes sense economically. If the demand for a scarce resource increases, the price must increase. So the solution is to try to expand the supply of the scarce resource, which in the case of blockchain networks means improving scalability. Unfortunately, what makes sense economically may not be fully aligned with the project\u2019s mission. Cardano targets economically weak countries and users. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to find appropriate solutions to make Cardano an inclusive network.\n\n# The current Cardano fee mechanism\n\nIn the Cardano ecosystem, network fees do not go directly to the block producer. Instead, they are pooled and then distributed to all pools that created blocks during an epoch.\n\nFees are constructed around two constants **a** and **b**. The formula for calculating minimal fees for a transaction is:\n\n>*a \\* size(tx) + b*\n\nThe two constants **a** and **b** are protocol parameters. These constants can be changed to be able to react and adapt to changes in transaction volume, hardware prices, and ADA valuation. **size(tx)** is the transaction size in bytes.\n\nConstant **a** reflects the dependence of the transaction cost on the size of the transaction. The larger the transaction, the more resources are needed to store and process it. The value of **b** is a payable fee, regardless of the size of the transaction. This parameter was primarily introduced to prevent Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nBoth constants **a** and **b** are expressed in ADA. This means that the fee is also in ADA, and you will pay approximately 0.17 ADA for a normal transaction (the larger the transaction, the higher the fee).\n\nNote that the fee expressed in USD value rises and falls according to the value of ADA in the market. If 1 ADA is worth 1 USD, the average fee is 0.17 USD. If the price of ADA goes up to USD 10, the fee will be USD 1.7.\n\nCardano selects transactions for a block-based on when they arrive at the current block producer. This means the first-come-first-serve system. Users can set a higher fee, but it plays no role. Moreover, the fee does not go directly to the block producer. All fees are distributed at the end of the epoch.\n\nThis system is fairer as everyone pays the same for the transaction. The rich are not favored and it is not possible to buy the advantage with money. However, the system is also not ideal. Fee levels are not stable, as the price of ADA can go up and down by hundreds of percent. The main drawback is that there is no preventive mechanism to guard against the flood of transactions. The system can essentially only process transactions incrementally. A few transactions can be temporarily stored in memory, but if it runs out of capacity, the transactions must be discarded.\n\nIf we go back to our bus analogy, people would line up at the bus stop as they come. As soon as the bus arrived, exactly 100 people would get on. The others would wait on. There would be a maximum of 200 people waiting at the bus stop. Everyone else would have to go home or wait around the corner until a seat opened up. The disadvantage is that even if the bus line is always fully loaded and there are many people waiting at the bus stop, the price of the service could remain the same or even decrease. Why?\n\nAs we said, the transaction fees are driven by the market value of ADA coins. If the value of the ADA coins were to go down, the fees would go down, despite the fact that demand is increasing. This does not make economic sense and can only work as long as the network can handle all the transactions.\n\nAny network can end up being forced to throw away transactions. This is simply because there is no place to store them. So users, or their wallets, have to resend the transactions. This is a general problem if the network in question does not scale. Dropping transactions is a defense against total overload. The usual solution is to prioritize transactions according to some rules. This does not prevent overflow, but at least it selects the more important transactions for the block.\n\n# Searching for the ideal fee mechanism\n\nIdeally, all blocks would be filled to, say, 95%. Every transaction would get into the block on the first try and everyone would pay the same low fees. The number of transactions would be enough to cover all the costs of the network. Network capacity would gradually grow as fast as the number of users. The fees would still be the same, or could even decrease as the number of transactions increases (the network would still collect the same amount of funds). For business, but also for everyday use, the stability of the economic environment is an absolutely key feature. A business cannot go out of business just because the fees on the transaction network go up. If all that was achieved then the network would be highly inclusive. Each new user would be happy with how user-friendly the network is. Pool operators and stakeholders would receive generous rewards. Everyone would be happy.\n\nThe ideal state is obviously difficult to achieve. Block occupancy will fluctuate in the next few years, but as the number of users grows, blocks will tend to get more and more full and run out of space. If the demand for transactions jumps, the networks will not be able to process them. If a network uses a fee market, fees will rise dramatically.\n\nThere is no ideal solution for fees. People want to pay the lowest possible fees. The network, and the people who run it, want to collect as much as possible. Users have limits and once the fees exceed them, they will not be willing to pay them. Some people will still pay $10 occasionally, but few people can afford $100 or more on a regular basis. However, USD 10 is an absolutely exorbitant fee for people from developing countries. These people can afford fees in the tens of cents at most. It should be remembered that for long-term speculators, it is no problem to pay a higher fee from time to time. However, if people are to use the network on a daily basis, the total value of all fees, for example for a whole month, must be low.\n\nNetwork bandwidth is limited at the technological level, which prevents the processing of large numbers of transactions. The reality is that resources will tend to be used to the maximum and the price of fees will go up. At the first layers, we are more likely to see full blocks of expensive transactions rather than large numbers of cheap transactions.\n\nThe only solution is to try to increase network throughput. The IOG team will strive to do this. However, as mentioned above, if network success outpaces technological progress, the network may not be able to handle the transactions.\n\nCardano will have a second layer called Hydra. There, transactions can be significantly faster and cheaper. The second layers have different parameters in terms of decentralization, security, and user-friendliness. It can be difficult for non-technical users to keep coins on one layer and transfer them to other layers. Ideally, users should not see the difference between layers at all. They would just check the box in their wallet if they want a faster and cheaper transaction. Any further manipulation of a different wallet or address is, from our perspective, too complicated for ordinary users.\n\nIt is necessary to think about the economic model of the first layer. If users pay fees on other layers or networks, how will the first layer fare economically? Probably worse. Ideally, the first and second layers should share an economic model. Thus, transaction fees on Hydra could also go, at least in part, to the Cardano network budget.\n\nThere is another side to this complex topic, which we will also just touch on. The budget of most networks is two-fold. It consists of monetary expansion, i.e. the stock of new coins that are put into circulation. Then there are the transaction fees collected. If a project has a cap on the number of coins, like Cardano or Bitcoin, the supply of new coins will one day be completely depleted? Thus, networks may be more dependent on the number of fees collected. The future price of coins will also matter. However, we cannot predict this well enough either. It is clear that the value of each network has a ceiling and the growth in the value of coins will also stop or slow down. The networks will depend mainly on the fees collected over the next few decades. It follows that they will either collect enough to ensure security and decentralization, or they will degrade these key features. Improving scalability is thus probably the only possible way to ensure low fees. Low fees will enable the usage and this, in turn, will enable network survival. An alternative path may be a shared economic model with second layers.\n\n# Transaction priority\n\nAs explained above, the network can easily get into a state where there are significantly more transactions available than can fit in a block. So some transactions have to wait for the next block, but they may not even get there. It may also happen that some transactions have to be discarded. There is one solution that is commonly used in such cases: transaction prioritization.\n\nWhat is the priority of transactions? We can talk about the purpose of the transactions, the number of coins and tokens in a transaction, etc. For example, a regular ADA transaction may have a higher priority than an NFT transaction. If there is a choice between two ADA transactions, the one with the higher amount will win. Alternatively, the number and time of transactions made from a given address can be taken into account.\n\nMaybe some kind of lottery could be devised to pick transactions at random. Maybe the block capacity could be divided into multiple subblocks. One sub-block would be filled by transactions based on a first-come, first-served basis. Another through a lottery, another based on the number of fees. There would be a mix of all the options and one could balance between them according to user needs.\n\nEven if a market fee mechanism were used, it could only be applied to part of the block capacity. This would allow low-fee transactions to enter the block, which would be selected on a lottery basis. At the same time, however, it would be possible to fight for block capacity with a high fee.\n\n# Burning fees\n\nEthereum has come up with another original concept. A portion of the fees is burned. This can theoretically make Ethereum deflationary. This means that the number of ETH in circulation can decrease if more ETH is burned than is created.\n\nThe deflationary model has the advantage of increasing the scarcity of existing coins and thus their value. Thus, if someone holds the coins, for example, an organization that cares about protocol, the value can grow over time. It\u2019s an interesting experiment and worth paying attention to.\n\nFrom our point of view, we see a mental problem there. In the ordinary world, we don\u2019t burn money or destroy gold. We try to use scarce resources for the purpose of appreciation. This is exactly what is happening with ADA coins in the Cardano ecosystem. For example, we can invest a portion of the fees collected in the development of the ecosystem to increase its usefulness to more people. This will in turn raise the value of the network, and hence of the project\u2019s coins. Burning coins do not necessarily prevent this, and the increase in value due to deflation can theoretically raise the overall value in the project treasury. Still, we think that coin burning is not an ideal solution. Especially since Cardano has a fixed number of coins.\n\nWe consider the one-time burning of part of the coins to be pure speculation with no long-term benefit. The value of the coins can be used for development. Burning may or may not raise the price in the short term, but in the long term, it is an irrelevant step. Especially with the current high volatility of all cryptocurrencies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA market fee is probably the inevitable solution. As we have described, it can only be applied to part of the block capacity. We do not think it would be good for Cardano to end up with users competing for block capacity through the amount of the fee. Cardano\u2019s advantage lies in its inclusiveness and user-friendliness. Clearly, this can\u2019t work forever and some changes need to come. Transaction prioritization can help to some extent, but once some transactions start getting thrown away or delayed in being included in the block, it will be a problem.\n\nPushing the boundaries of scalability and clever second layer involvement will be essential in the future. All projects are at the beginning of this and essentially in the experimentation and development phase.

I needed something that was going to make me lots of money in the medium to long term. I looked at Bitcash and was convinced it was it, only because I imagined that the value would climb up to the current price of BTC. I logged on to Paypal to buy it but for some reason, they would not accept my card payment. After several attempts, I gave up and went to bed. I was destined for something else :)\n\nThe next day I watched a few videos about Crypto and discovered there is more to cryptocurrency than Bitcoin. I looked into the top 20 altcoins and discovered Cardano ADA. I was impressed with the vision, the peer-to-peer review, the green ecosystem, and the whole philosophy built around Cardano. It ticked all the boxes for me. I am no tech guy and have no idea what PAB does but I understand is a technology that will enhance the platform to build daps. Other software such as Haskell, Plutus, Marlowe, or Glow I hear is good. Offering better security, scalability, and all the other benefits which I don't understand. What impressed me the most is the importance of building a secure functioning system that can benefit the mass, which is verified to win my trust. So I asked myself this question if the technology is verified, is it not just a matter of time before it's fully functional, and when it is how can such technology be worthless?  yes, it's taking longer to get there but when it does, no one can deny its accomplishment and will refuse to use it. When it offers, cheaper, faster, greener transactions.\n\nDuring my research, I understood there are cycles Cryptocurrency goes through which gave me the confidence not to concern myself with the ups and downs as I am invested for the long term.

Examples of burn mechanisms are burning some or all of the transaction fees or burning some of the funds held by the DAO or foundation treasury.\n\nMost coins do not have burn mechanisms, but some do, for example Ethereum which recently started burning transaction fees. As with any tokenomics decision, there is a tradeoff.\n\nDisadvantages to burning coins:\n\n1. It costs coins to burn coins. When burning transactions fees, transactions must either become more expensive to support transaction fee burning, or the stakers/node operators must earn less rewards.\n2. When transaction fees are burned, there is less incentive for people to actually use the network, but encouraging actual use is important for adoption. There will also be less financial incentive for stakers/node operators due to lower rewards, which means less secure network.\n3. Instead of burning coins, those funds could be used for R&D, marketing, etc.\n4. There will no longer be a known fixed maximum supply. One reason people like Bitcoin is that it has an immutable known 21 million total coin supply.\n\nAdvantages to burning coins:\n\n1. It makes coins scarcer, which could indirectly enrich people who hold the coins and people who don't do that many transactions.\n2. Transaction fee burning discourages transactions by making them more expensive to do. This helps with reducing blockchain congestion and bloat, which may be beneficial for a project like Ethereum right now, but pretty unnecessary for Cardano.\n3. Treasury funds burning alleviates concerns coin holders may have about there being too much funds held by the treasury and that it may be dumped or misused. Some projects do have very large treasury funds and could alleviate that concern by burning, but the Cardano organizations with ADA treasuries do not have that large a portion of the total supply. They've also been wisely using those funds for things like Project Catalyst, which helps the Cardano ecosystem grow.\n\nSo there are projects which already have very high usage, i.e. Ethereum and Binance/Binance Smart Chain, and they can afford to use their large amount of generated fees to burn coins, even if it may be a less than optimal way to use funds (In Binance's case it is different than just \"deciding to burn coins one day\" in that they said they would burn coins to a fixed 100m supply as part of their initial white paper tokenomics).\n\nBut Cardano is at a stage where it needs to keep gaining users and network activity, has no network congestion issue like Ethereum, and so it would not benefit from throwing away transaction fees. It will also not benefit from burning treasury funds because they are a small portion of total supply, and the funds are not excessive and are being used well.", {"entities": [[1152, 1159, "crypto"], [4, 11, "crypto"], [55, 62, "crypto"], [1623, 1630, "crypto"], [1893, 1900, "crypto"], [2082, 2089, "crypto"], [2542, 2549, "crypto"], [1920, 1923, "crypto"]]}], ["I stand behind Cardano, one of the most exciting platforms in crypto.This has been a rough week for a lot of us.

Whenever we miss selling the top, our gut sinks. What you don't realize is that even if you timed it *PERFECTLY*, what you'd be running back to is a failed monetary system. Fiat currency is doomed. This isn't some tinfoil hat type of take, it's really doomed. ***HALF of the USD's circulating supply was printed in the last two years alone.*** \n\nI'm really starting to think that this bull run has little to do with the 4 year cycle Bitcoin has undergone in the past decade. No. This is millions of well funded investors abandoning fiat currency. Now is the time to rediscover what we're really fighting for: decentralization. \n\nCharles pointed out the strength and positivity shown by the Cardano community. Despite it not giving insane returns when everything else was moving, all of us continued following the project and staying involved in whatever way we can. Whether it be through voting, staking, or just simply listening to each other. We continued to support each other, knowing that our eyes are set on the next decade of growth.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some Cardano projects found new life in this positive atmosphere.

These numbers are probably way worse in poorer countries. On the other side, In Canada (where I'm at rn), you can get a mortgage for 2-4% interest rate.\n\nIdentity solution (Atala Prism), government deals (Ethiopia), Cheap Internet (World Mobile), borrowing and lending (MELD, Liqwid ...), Insurance, Hydra (high TPS), Mithril (better light wallets): These are the important things needed to onboard the masses from 3rd world countries.\n\nThis is what makes Cardano different from others. Ethereum and most other smart contract blockchain's approach to this is that: We are building an open system, and whoever wants to use or build on it can do so freely. This is not a bad idea because you get to focus on making better tech, but since this is a relativity new technology, the ones who are progressive about working with governments will have a better chance of succeeding. This is where the decentralization of the blockchain will matter because no country will want to run their system on a blockchain where a few people own the majority of tokens. \n\nThe farmer is not thinking about the PAB release this month, so he can trade some shitcoins on sundae swap. He wants a reliable infrastructure so that he doesn't get grinded by debt from high interest.\n\nThe only other blockchain (that I know of) trying to build this infrastructure is Algorand in El Salvador.\n\nThis is what Cardano is trying to solve. It is the platform trying to provide equality of opportunity to the whole world. Ambitious target but worth giving it a shot. Again, deep down I might be in it just for the money, but it makes it a lot less stressful to hodl thinking supporting these protocols can improve the lives of many others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHY HASKELL?\n\nI'm a Computer Science student and this semester I took a class on Haskell, so I ain't an expert, but these are some things that make it great for this use case.\n\n\\- Way easier to convert math into code in Haskell than in any other language I know of.\n\n\\- All pure functions makes the outcome highly predictable and theoretically provable, making it very secure. Will play a key role in the dapp store with certification labels being build rn.\n\n\\- Robust type system makes it less prone to error\n\nMath, Security, Predictability is what you need for a great blockchain based banking infrastructure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea centralized high throughput blockchains for gaming and NFT in cool for making money for people sitting in their dad's basement like me, but real world is changed by hard work and slow and steady approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain I'm just a 20 year old kid so apologies if I have messed up some details.", {"entities": [[19, 26, "crypto"], [720, 727, "crypto"], [1641, 1648, "crypto"]]}], ["Cardano needs an ecosystem similar to Ethereum\u2019s Curve and MakerDAO protocols.", {"entities": [[0, 7, "crypto"]]}], ["How can I use Cardano currently?What are cardano's legitimate actual uses right now?", {"entities": [[14, 21, "crypto"]]}], ["Cardano - robust, resilient and flexibile.

All of the links I shared are distinct websites regurgitating the same misunderstanding.  To me, this looks like some sort of astro-turfing FUD attack on Cardano.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems the original article(s) used [this](https://smartcontracts.vercel.app) website as a source.  At the time, that website didn't distinguish between active smart contracts and time locks related to token minting policy.  That website uses [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/sc) as a source.  At the time I am writing this, adapools shows that there are 271 active smart contracts, live on the network.  Adapools does not seem to show how many smart contracts have been executed and are no longer live.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the time-locks \"issue\", there is no issue.  Time locks are a *feature*.  They are often implemented via token minting policy, but could be used for any smart contract.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/ppu4rs/cardano_daily_discussion_questions_market_thread/hd8dtdo/?context=1) is a great discussion on the matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCardano smart contracts are live.  There is nothing preventing smart contracts from operating on the network.  Developers are waiting for the release of the Plutus Application Backend which is a tool that dramatically reduces the effort required to have a large scale project interact with the Cardano blockchain and smart contracts.

Let me explain whyCurrently, there is a post on the frontpage saying that ADA is overhyped. While the author has some points, most of them can be countered pretty easily. Let me explain\n\nDisclaimer: I am mainly comparing ADA to ETH in this post, and I do not prefer one coin over the other. While I will try to be as objective as possible, for transparency reasons I want you to know that I hold both of them in my personal Portfolio\n\nLet me now list all the arguments people use against Cardano\n\n\"ADA doesn't have a working product\"\n\nActually, this isn't correct. First of all, they already have a working POS system, which can't be said about ETH. ADA already has a lot of strategic partnerships, for example the Ethiopian government, which is planning to use a licenced copy of the blockchain to store its students data. \n\n\"ADA has been in development for years!\"\n\nYes, but so does any other crypto, ethereum is still in development, too. This is what makes it great. A working product is a less risky investment, but it also leads to less potential growth. IOHK is developing cardano slowly because they want to get it right and are backing it with research This approach is, in my opinion, the best possible one, as it should eliminate potential fatal errors before a full rollout. \n\n\"ADA is only big because Charles is manipulating its community!\"\n\nCharles is engaging with its community all the time, thats right. But he isn't shilling ada. Everything he says is backed by facts, the only thing he is doing is keeping the community updated on the project and providing transparency in the development process. In stark contrast to a lot of other crypto devs, which usually have limited community engagement, Charles is keeping the ADA community up to date, and I am thankful for that \n\n\"ADA will never kill ETH\"\n\nIt doesn't have to. Multiple PoS chains can coexist, that's the point of decentralisation. Not being forced to use a certain service by a certain company. Charles himself never said that ADA is an eth killer, quite the opposite, he thinks ADA and ETH can co-exist\n\nI am really excited about the future of cardano because I think it is an amazing project with lots of potential. I will keep loading my bags with ada because I believe in it's team and technology\n\nBut please take everything I said with a grain of salt, I am just a random person on the internet\n\nEdit: typo", {"entities": [[258, 261, "crypto"], [675, 678, "crypto"], [1844, 1847, "crypto"], [2097, 2100, "crypto"], [518, 525, "crypto"], [104, 107, "crypto"], [251, 254, "crypto"], [528, 531, "crypto"], [680, 683, "crypto"], [857, 860, "crypto"], [1320, 1323, "crypto"], [1768, 1771, "crypto"], [1824, 1827, "crypto"], [2037, 2040, "crypto"], [2089, 2092, "crypto"]]}], ["For all you Cardano haters out there.People seemed bullish on Binance giving a billion dollars for developing their ecosystem.

Disruptive technology replaces or fundamentally changes the old systems or people\u2019s habits because using the new technology has recognizably better features. Adoption is quite natural, as there are advantages in terms of cost, user-friendliness, performance, or simply convenience.\n\nExamples of disruptive technologies are television, the automobile, and the Internet. The Internet has managed to disrupt literally almost every industry in its years of existence. Many global companies have emerged with significant societal impact. Amazon has been disruptive with respect to the business model of traditional bookstores. Google has been disruptive with respect to searching for and verifying information. In fact, disruption happens almost constantly and the blockchain industry can be seen as a logical extension of the success of the Internet.\n\nIt is important to remember that no disruptive technology comes into the world with a better solution right from the start. Disruptive innovation creates an entirely new market or model that is initially judged to be inferior based on performance indicators valued by mainstream customers and users. Most people are satisfied with existing services, but new entrants can quickly capture a large market share by serving needs that did not previously exist.\n\nTo ensure that the adoption of disruptive technology will continue, it is important to keep working on improvements, efficiency, and performance. New disruptive services must align with what people in mainstream markets already value. In other words, it is necessary to outperform existing solutions on the market. It is even said that innovation needs to be up to 10 times better than existing solutions to be massively successful. The innovation may be the best, but if it does not meet the expectations of a large number of users, there will be no mass adoption and only a small group of enthusiasts or fans will use the technology. Notice that if there is no mass adoption, we cannot talk about disruption, because there will be no fundamental changes in society.\n\nLet\u2019s explain with an example. The first automobiles did not disrupt the market of horse-drawn vehicles in the late 19th century. Most people were very skeptical at the beginning and continued to make extensive use of horses. The first cars were expensive, unreliable, less efficient, and even considered dangerous. Gradual innovations for luxury transportation kept the car idea alive. It was much later that cars began to make their way into the mainstream, at a time when they could be produced more cheaply, were more efficient, more reliable and legislation was in place. If improvements had not been made gradually, we might still be riding horses today. Cars were, at their beginning, an experiment that succeeded. However, success was not automatically guaranteed, and that is true of any other disruptive technology.\n\nMany products considered disruptive take years to be adopted by people or businesses, or are not adopted at all. The Segway electric vehicle was once touted as a disruptive technology until it wasn\u2019t. In retrospect, no one knows exactly why the Segway didn\u2019t become a success. Instead, e-bikes or other alternative vehicles, such as the Onewheel, have proliferated.\n\nDo you think we have perfect cars today and there is nothing to improve? Cars continue to improve in every conceivable way. Modern cars have more range, less fuel consumption, are more environmentally friendly, are connected to the internet, can navigate and even drive themselves. Do you think there will never be another disruption in the transport industry? We wouldn\u2019t bet on it. With the advent of AI and the demands for a cleaner and more pleasant environment, we can imagine many things including flying cars.\n\nDo you think Uber is a disruptive company? It\u2019s not. Uber has only secured significant market share through technological improvements to an already existing industry. Uber has made it easier to order cabs and make payments. Uber was cheaper and customers could rate the service. It is an improvement, not a disruption. The traditional taxi service still works and Uber has significant competition. In some countries, Uber is outperformed by other services.\n\nAutomobiles allowed us to travel long distances, transport goods, or allow us to work further from home. The automobile industry has influenced other industries. No one uses horses for transport in developed countries today. The automobile has completely replaced its predecessor. Uber is not a disruptor in the full sense of the term. Uber has been successful largely because traditional taxi services were expensive and inefficient. Uber\u2019s economic model was on the edge of the law in many countries and legislation had to be changed.\n\n### Why does disruption occur?\n\nEmpirical findings have shown that in the context of sustaining innovation, incumbent firms outperform new entrants, but underperform in the context of disruptive innovation. Smart disruptors gradually improve their products and raise their market level. The focus of established firms on their existing customers becomes institutionalized into internal processes that make it difficult for even top managers to shift investment into disruptive innovation.\n\nThis explains why incumbent companies rarely (if ever) responded effectively to disruptive innovations, but not why new entrants eventually moved upmarket and challenged incumbents again and again. It turns out, however, that the same forces that drive incumbent firms to ignore early-stage disruptions eventually drive disruptors to be disrupted as well.\n\nTechnological innovation is a process that cannot be stopped, as people are constantly improving and refining everything around them. If an entrant comes into an established market, it wants to establish itself, and one way to do that is to come up with something completely new. Entrants have no existing customers to worry about, so they can focus all their resources on innovation. It\u2019s only natural that sooner or later someone will succeed.\n\nBlockchain projects, or rather their teams, are still disruptors. A fundamental disruption of markets, habits, and business models has not yet occurred. Once that happens, new disruptors will emerge to challenge blockchain technology. Eventually, innovations will emerge on a scale that completely replaces the first generation. Once the team of a given blockchain project begins to focus on existing users and resigns itself to improvement and disruption, it will likely be disrupted itself. The mantra \u201cdisrupt or be disrupted\u201d has worked the same way for centuries. The evolution will be very similar to that of banks or large IT giants. The banking sector, in particular, has slept through the development of modern technology. Today, we can transfer information in milliseconds. The same must be possible with value. The internet and blockchain know no national borders. This is one of the many reasons for their success.\n\nIn principle, it is not possible to clearly define whether a particular disruption should be evaluated positively or negatively. A disruption will always be desirable for one group and undesirable for another. The overall assessment will therefore always be mixed and will change over time. It is quite logical that people were skeptical about blockchain at the beginning. This is slowly starting to change. The positives and potential benefits are more visible. People\u2019s attitudes are changing.\n\nIsn\u2019t blockchain like Uber? If blockchain, or its second layers, can transfer value faster, cheaper and more reliably than traditional financial services, isn\u2019t this just a significant improvement? At first glance, it would seem so, but it is not. Blockchain technology is truly disruptive, and we will return to this topic.\n\n### Disruption is a process full of uncertainty\n\nThe term disruptive innovation might evoke the impression that something appeared at one moment and succeeded. The success of innovative technology is rather a long gradual process. The theory suggests that adoption is very low at the beginning and only gradually increases over time as the service continues to innovate. We can even talk about an experiment for a small group of people that either catches on and becomes mainstream or disappears. The adoption process takes time, years, or even decades. Moreover, traditional services can be quite inventive in defending their positions. It happens that a promising startup is acquired by a strong player in the market. Fortunately, this option does not exist in the world of cryptocurrencies. Cardano cannot be bought by a payment service or a bank. The decentralization of the network is a feature that is itself disruptive. Imagine that no one directly owns the global payment network and the profits from its existence are distributed across multiple owners, large or small.\n\nTraditional strong market players in the industry, but also people, are not able to recognize disruptive technologies in time. They tend to be skeptical about them. Big players are often strong in sustaining innovation because they want to retain their consumers. They are nearly always unable to invest in disruptive technology. This is because they want to minimize risk and invest mainly in maintaining and expanding the business.\n\nBlockchain is still a relatively new technology. Experts agree that it is a disruptive technology. However, this does not mean that success is guaranteed. It is common with disruptive technologies that people fail to get a good sense of the potential. There are many reasons for this. People are generally afraid of new things and reject them. People have been afraid of cars, but also of the Internet. The Internet was associated with scams and with the adult industry in its early days. The media was very skeptical of this innovation and one of the reasons was that the Internet media was a threat to the print media. The first e-shop purchases and the scams associated with them were reported in the newspapers. Now we shop on the Internet quite routinely.\n\nThe advent of disruptive technologies brings many risks and uncertainties. Disruption brings changes in business models and financial flows. It puts jobs at risk and can shift wealth into other hands. New technologies may not meet normal standards and legislation may be lacking. Regulations must therefore be addressed. Fear of pollution and low efficiency may be reasons for rejecting innovation. People may not properly understand disruptive technology and its significance, let alone be able to see all the changes it can bring. It is therefore common for people to think that current solutions are the best possible and that replacing them with new technology is not possible.\n\nBlockchain meets the criteria of disruptive technology in this respect. People are still uncertain about how far adoption can go and what all industries blockchain can change. The low scalability and therefore unusability for the masses is pointed out. PoW consensus is seen as a threat to the environment. Lawmakers still do not know how to approach cryptocurrencies properly and how to regulate them well so as not to stifle innovation.\n\nBlockchain will evolve like any other innovation in the coming decades. Scalability won\u2019t be a problem, PoS is significantly greener than PoW, and regulation will hopefully come soon. As the technology improves, it will become increasingly clearer what we can specifically change and what industries will undergo fundamental change. We may not know all the answers at this point, just as we didn\u2019t know them in the early days of the internet. Could anyone have foreseen, for example, social networks or even internet banking? How many people were able to predict the arrival of cryptocurrencies? Strong and unsubstantiated opinions are also a typical example of emerging disruptive technology. Some people will always try to defend their positions, but they cannot resist innovation.\n\nIf innovation is technologically capable of disrupting an industry, there is a good chance it will happen. If the reader isn\u2019t sure what all blockchain can bring to the world, that\u2019s perfectly fine. No one knows. Those who claim to know may not be right. Things that are obstacles today may be a solved problem tomorrow. Estimating the rate of adoption is very difficult, as no one knows exactly how quickly obstacles will be overcome and what other obstacles will be encountered. There may be new demands from users which will be new challenges to overcome.\n\nLet\u2019s try a little thought exercise. Imagine that Cardano is infinitely scalable, the blockchain uses sharding so there is no problem with its size, every transaction happens in under a second, regulators won\u2019t prevent blockchain adoption, governments and financial systems decide to decentralize their infrastructure. Every person on the planet can participate in decentralization. When you think about it, it\u2019s really all about the development of technology. Once the current technological obstacles are overcome, many doors will open.\n\nDisruption takes time and doesn\u2019t happen overnight. The IOG team knows well that only pushing the boundaries of what is possible can lead to the success of the blockchain industry. Just a few years ago, people liked to say that blockchain was an expensive and slow database. Computers were like that in the beginning. That is no longer true in the case of computers. In a few years, it won\u2019t be true of blockchain either. We\u2019ve already moved up several orders of magnitude in many parameters. In the case of blockchain, once the technical problems are solved, we can start talking about solving financial and social problems.\n\nAnother concomitant of the rise of disruptive technology is exaggerated expectations, hype, and bubbles. At the beginning of adoption, people may think that the impact and scale of disruption will be greater than they actually will be in the end. People invest in dreams and expectations and like to believe the hype. This is why bubbles are created in terms of market capitalization. Because technology development and adoption are slow processes, markets are very volatile. There are alternating phases of excitement and disappointment.\n\nIn 2018, after a massive bull run, came the crypto winter. At this time, technology was catching up to expectations. Everyone thought blockchain would change the world, but there were still PoW project clones in the top 10. At that time, technology was not ready for the major changes in society. It is possible that we will go through at least one more such period before challenging goals can be realized.\u00a0\n\nIn 2017, people invested in promises and dreams. The main difference in 2021 is that people want to try projects and are looking for real jobs. Companies, businesses, and countries are considering the use of blockchain technology. Cardano, as one of the few projects that are ready for adoption, is a logical choice. However, expectations are still higher than what technology will allow. The trajectories of expectations and the real possibilities of blockchain technology will one day meet. No one knows exactly when, and we are talking in orders of magnitude of years. Don\u2019t be surprised if we see more bubbles and crypto winter. Do not think that it is over and that technology will disappear from the world. Teams just need more time to make technological progress.\n\nIt is also quite normal for some projects to fail. New projects emerge that learn from the mistakes of their predecessors and succeed. This iterative approach is also quite normal. Many people want to piggyback on the success of emerging technology. But only the best or the most tenacious will succeed. Out of thousands of projects, only three may succeed in the long run. In the meantime, new ones may emerge.\n\n### Is blockchain disruptive technology?\n\nAre blockchain and cryptocurrencies really disruptive technology? The consensus among experts is that it is. Despite the many reservations mentioned above, it seems that blockchain and cryptocurrencies can disrupt existing business models and established orders.\u00a0\n\nVarious crypto-community groups and experts are arguing over whether the phrase \u201cBitcoin, not blockchain\u201d or rather \u201cBlockchain, not Bitcoin\u201d applies. With each passing year, it becomes more apparent that it is the latter phrase that applies. Bitcoin is just one of many possible implementations of blockchain technology. Decentralized networks and blockchain are no longer something that companies and governments should be afraid of. At the time of writing, Charles Hoskinson and his team are in Africa meeting with state representatives and presidents. They are talking about the digital transformation of countries and Cardano can play a significant role in this. These countries will skip using traditional client-server-based solutions and blockchain can be the backbone of these countries.\u00a0\n\nOf course, there will be representatives of the group that proclaims \u201cBitcoin, not blockchain\u201d and will challenge these efforts. This is perfectly normal. Once the first successes are apparent, these petty debates will end. Decentralization itself is a disruptive concept. Decentralized networks and blockchain is the technological solution that will make decentralization possible. Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others are implementations of the concept with different characteristics that will find application to different problems. There is no point in trying to fit a single, unsuitable solution to all problems. In practice, the opposite is true. We look for the best solution to a particular problem. Decentralization primarily solves problems associated with loss of trust, abuse of power, and inefficiencies associated with slow processes involving people. These problems can be seen almost everywhere around us.\n\nWe need to ask a key question to get an answer to whether blockchain is a disruptive technology. Which industries might be transformed via blockchain? It is still a hot topic of many debates. The most possible and discussed candidates are money, financial services, supply chains, health, property rights, telecom, energy and climate, manufacturing, identity, government.\n\nDo you have doubts about the disruption of any of the sectors on the list? That is perfectly fine and appropriate. No one knows exactly how or when it will happen. It may only be a partial success. We may need more time than we now think and more technological innovation in other areas. The reason for the uncertainty is that blockchain is changing the way trust and ownership work from the bottom up. The disruption is about trust, which is an absolutely essential attribute of human interaction and the functioning of society.\u00a0\n\nThe Internet operates on the basis of trust in a centralized entity that is further controlled by the legal system. This structure has been used by mankind for centuries. Decentralization undermines this basic concept. If there is disruption at a technological level, i.e. on the Internet, the legal system will probably also have to change. Experts in blockchain technology may have an idea of what disruption may occur at the technological level. What is difficult to predict is what change or disruption will occur at the level of regulations, laws, and states.\n\nLet\u2019s talk briefly about what sectors can be disrupted. Blockchain came up with the idea of creating alternative money. If we allow for success in this area, the disruption of the entire financial sector is the next logical step. DeFi is exactly about this sector, so it\u2019s already happening. If we\u2019re going to own money and do without intermediaries, there\u2019s no reason not to do the same for stocks. If governments allow alternative money to exist, why should they prevent stocks from existing on the blockchain? Will governments even exist in their current form if people use non-state money? Or will governments mandate the use of cryptocurrencies by the constitution, like in El Salvador? Clearly, if cryptocurrencies and blockchain succeed, governments must necessarily change somehow. Cardano will enable the creation of a decentralized identity through Atala PRISM. This solution is used by the government of Ethiopia and also by a Fortune 250 company Dish. Governments in developing countries are adopting blockchain solutions into their governance.\n\nDoes the disruption of the financial sector depend on the disruption of money through Bitcoin? Financial sector disruption can occur through stable coins. Cardano will have its stable coin Djed whose value will be derived from a basket of assets and the Djed will be backed by digital assets, primarily ADA coins. Bitcoin is not needed to stabilize value, tokenize stocks, make loans, and many other things. In other words, the disruption of different sectors can take place on different blockchain solutions. It is even almost certain that companies or countries will use different networks. In the future, we may see new payment networks and banking services existing on different blockchain networks and competing with each other. This is beneficial for everyone as the whole financial world will be more robust. It would be very dangerous if the whole world were to rely on a single network.\n\nLet\u2019s play the visionary. Do you still remember the 2020 US presidential election? Even at the time of writing, the outcome of the election is still in doubt. In some states, people who are long dead have reportedly voted. There are questions about the quality of the vote count. Voting is an absolutely essential process in democratic states and it has to be said that it does not work well. Blockchain is an infrastructure that is perfectly suited to vote collection and counting. Since the blockchain is decentralized, no party or entity can control it to influence elections. The blockchain is ubiquitous, so no one can stop anyone from voting. Anyone voting can verify that their vote has been counted. No one can cheat in the counting process as everything will be automated. Election results will be available immediately after the polls close. We can imagine that blockchain will also be applied at this very crucial level for the state. Experiments are underway at this level as well. Hundreds of thousands of people vote in the Catalyst project. There have been several rounds and no one has reported any fraud or other problems. Digital voting cannot be created on a client-server architecture, as someone always controls the servers. A decentralized infrastructure is suitable for many tasks in the relationship between people and authorities.\n\nSome experts even think the impact of blockchain on society will be greater than the Internet. The Internet brought upon a revolution that would change the way the world would operate forever, and since its initial inception in 1983, the year often considered to be the official birth year of the Internet, it has evolved from a simple military communication network to the world\u2019s central cyberspace. In almost 40 years, the Internet has changed fundamentally, and it is almost certain that blockchain technology will do the same. Probably faster.\u00a0\n\nWhile one of the primary factors for the creation of the Internet was to make the transfer of data between computers effortless and seamless. Blockchain\u2019s purpose is to verify the authenticity of digital data and allow people to own it without third parties. The distributed network allows for programmability and data operations. Thus, it is possible to create, for example, a monetary system where a decentralized network oversees the pre-set rules of the game.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate this again with an example. Paper records are not suitable for the Internet because paper cannot be transferred. The documents, therefore, had to be digitized. The documents reside on a server and are available at client request. The server can find the document and it is displayed in the client\u2019s browser. It is relatively difficult and expensive to ensure the authenticity of the document and it is not possible to clearly identify the owner if this is required (unless it is part of the document itself). With blockchain, physical paper records can be fully replaced with trusted digital records. The blockchain can ensure that an existing digital document can be linked to a digital identity (for example, to a publisher or owner), ensuring that the original content of the document never changes (more precisely, it is easy to determine the original content). The blockchain is not there to store documents and take care of digital transmission. Blockchain can provide confidence in the authenticity of a digital asset and hold the information associated with ownership. Smart contracts can define the processes associated with these assets. Oracles or AI can provide a layer of understanding of document content.\n\nThe basic building blocks of the Internet are actually very simple. The whole Internet is really just about data transmission. All the companies and services you use every day take advantage of this feature built on a client-server architecture. You can think of every server on the network as a point of centralization and an entity you have to trust. Blockchain mainly brings decentralization. Instead of one specific and known entity, you trust the network when it comes to owning and dealing with data. The basic building blocks of blockchain are also very simple and allow for many implementations. Every single blockchain project is like trying to create a new company or business model in the early days of the internet. Most projects will die out, some successful ones will be around for decades and will be used by the whole world.\n\nBlockchain is still in an experimental phase where new solutions and business models are being explored. This makes it difficult for people to point to a winner. Once a given solution proves to be workable and adoption increases, uncertainty, FUD, and volatility will be replaced by certainty and stability. New companies similar to Amazon, Google, or Facebook will emerge from the blockchain space, but they will be fundamentally different structurally because they are based on a Peer-to-Peer architecture. These networks will be owned and operated by the same people who use them. If the network becomes centralized, people will simply go elsewhere. The main criterion for success is likely to be the quality of decentralization and the quality of other features that are important from a usage perspective. Blockchain is a disruptive technology and we are just looking for the limits of disruption.\n\n### Cardano is being built for the long run\u00a0game\n\nBlockchain is a disruptive technology, but the extent of the disruption is difficult to estimate at this point. New paradigms are consistently overestimated in the short run and underestimated in the long run. Cardano is being built slowly and with careful consideration in order to be around for several decades and deliver the functionality needed to disrupt several industries.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to disrupt money, financial services, property rights, identity, or even governments in a short period of time. None of this is purely about technology, but also about people, current habits, laws, and regulations. Money and the current financial system have the largest network effect in the world. Everything is protected by laws and regulations. This cannot be overcome by technology alone. China decided to drive the miners out of their country and it has done so in a short time. Then it made it impossible for people to access the crypto exchanges. Don\u2019t expect DeFi services to thrive in China. People won\u2019t be able to access them. The Chinese are not likely to protest and fight for cryptocurrencies in a big way. Adoption of cryptocurrencies will generally be much easier in countries where there is a need for modern technology (there is no traditional financial system) or where there is a democratic regime.\n\nCardano will participate in the disruption of society, but laws and regulations will affect the extent and possibilities. Shares or property ownership on the blockchain is not so much a technological hurdle today, but a regulatory one. If the law makes it possible to own shares and other things on the blockchain, Cardano and other networks could be the global backbone of the financial world. Regulators may have certain requirements for functionality, privacy, or transparency, but in principle, they have no reason to prefer a conventional database over a blockchain. Once the requirements are clear, the IOG team can deliver the necessary missing functionality. Will it take a year, five or ten years? It would be nice to see a few countries in the world that would approve such regulations. It could happen in developing countries. The system will need to work reliably for let\u2019s say 5 years. Then others will rush to follow.\n\nObviously, many other technical problems and issues will arise during the adoption process. People still encounter the complexity of using cryptocurrencies and blockchain services. The loss of wealth or personal data when private keys are lost is unhappy. The low or unclear link between the digital and physical worlds might prevent usage. Clearly, the scope for innovation is large. It makes sense to point out things that are not working well today. But it also makes sense to look for solutions.\n\nThe development is definitely not over, and if Cardano and blockchain as a concept are to succeed, we still have many hurdles to overcome. People need to be able to use blockchain services with similar ease and security as they use internet banking. The strength of the blockchain lies mainly in the fact that asset owners hide certain cryptographic secrets. If the secret is lost or stolen, the wealth is also lost. You may lose the token representing the house, but it will continue to exist. What about it? Obviously, some more complex system and solution will have to emerge. Working with identity and biometrics may end up being absolutely crucial for many scenarios. Is working with biometrics a great thing for traditional services? Well, it will be a great thing for blockchain too.\n\nThe IOG team and other associated developers will be absolutely essential to the future of the Cardano ecosystem for pretty much the lifetime of the network, as the requirements for technical solutions grow with increasing adoption, usability, and new application ideas. As we have already explained, a given solution must be continuously improved and innovated by the team. Should this not be the case, a competitor or even a disruptor will emerge.\n\nThe Bitcoin community believes that the protocol must not innovate too quickly if it should innovate at all. Bitcoin is the only one that can afford to do so if it becomes a store of value. For other projects, the situation is very different. Cardano aims to create a new financial and social system primarily for people in developing countries. Adoption can happen in cooperation with governments. Adoption is all about communication and certain requirements can be expected to be met. The goals and mission of the Cardano project differ from Bitcoin in almost every way. Cardano must be a scalable, versatile, and 100% reliable system. It will have to be able to do a lot of things because traditional financial services and authorities do a lot of things. A simple loan is a more complex financial service that cannot be reliably implemented on Bitcoin in a decentralized way. Cardano will have to be able to handle that.\n\nDisruptive technologies provide an opportunity for other technologies or services to emerge, or for existing ones to be used in a slightly different way. Cryptocurrencies, for example, have led to hardware wallets that have fundamentally improved the security of safekeeping. It is possible to innovate further at this level and new players will quite naturally emerge. People are even willing to build a chip into their own bodies to protect their wealth. Could this be the norm in 20 years? It may well be.\n\n### Why people are unable to assess the potential of\u00a0Cardano\n\nIt is difficult to estimate Cardano\u2019s potential unless we look to the future. No one can predict the future, and most of our predictions end up a little different than we expected. From a certain perspective, the advent of cryptocurrencies and their targets may look somewhat bold. Would you bet on cryptocurrencies replacing all the financial systems in the world within, say, 20 years? I assure you that most people on the planet would not bet on it. It\u2019s a too disruptive idea and no one can fully estimate the consequences. Moreover, this idea raises many questions. For example, what will happen to governments, what will happen to banks, what rules will we follow, how will elections be run, etc. It is only natural that we do not believe in such fundamental social changes, because we know that the current system is relatively stable in most countries on the planet. There are countries that may not be stable or free. These countries would need major social or political transformation. Change can be much more difficult in these countries.\n\nAs we have already said, new paradigms are constantly overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term. Blockchain will fundamentally change society, but change takes time and the outcome may be different than we currently think. People think that cryptocurrencies will only succeed if we pay with them. Maybe that will happen in the long term, but in the short term, it makes more sense to build alternative financial services. For this use case, we don\u2019t directly need volatile cryptocurrencies. Stable coins are enough. The same can be said for tokenized stocks, or platforms that allow us to take out a loan. In El Salvador, they need a primarily cheap network that allows them to send cheap cross-border transactions. It makes sense to build decentralized networks and services, but it does not make sense to force people to risk their wealth in the wild world of cryptocurrencies. The need to hold cryptocurrencies must not be a prerequisite for using a decentralized network.\n\nThere is a fierce struggle between different crypto communities not only on the technological level but mainly on the ideological level. Some people believe that the coins of their projects will be the only universal money on the planet and nothing else matters. They think we need to replace the money and then get rid of the states. They even think that technological progress in other projects is a scam and a hindrance. This noise and personal financial incentives to promote projects that people have invested in also make the market less transparent. Ideology is part of adoption, but at a certain stage, it can become a problem. The blockchain revolution is built on technology. It makes use of distributed networks, cryptography, and blockchain. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to build a strong new ideology over technology. Of course, technology has an impact on society. If we want to replace the financial system, there must be social pressure and demand. However, the social pressure must have one voice, the common denominator of which will be technological progress.\n\nCardano is certainly not a project whose primary use is based on paying by ADA coins. That is of course possible, and people can do it. However, this use case is very limiting in terms of possibilities and disruption. If you want to pay for music, for example, you may be put off by the very fact that you are getting rid of a cryptocurrency you would rather continue to hold. If you pay for music by cryptocurrencies and everything will be the same as by paying by fiat, nothing will change. You will probably pay some middleman, not the artist directly. In this scenario, the medium of exchange has been replaced, but there is no disruption at the business model level. Of course, there would probably be a disruption at the level of money or national sovereignty. But then we might ask whether there would be an entity that would protect copyright. It is certainly possible to change the business model without blockchain and look for ways to pay the artist directly. However, this is not happening in a big way and blockchain offers completely new and unexplored possibilities.\n\nCardano wants to succeed through its versatility, utility, and ability to build new layers of trust over the Internet. Cardano\u2019s job description is to disrupt existing unfair business models and improve them. The ability to cut out the middleman is essential to success. Trust must be established directly between the seller and the buyer. Can this be done through tokens? Hard to say, probably yes. At the moment, there is no question of how exactly some things will happen. Rather, it is interesting to ask whether it is even possible to disrupt existing orders and allow entirely new business models to emerge. It makes sense to try different concepts.\n\nWhich is more likely, to disrupt states and national monetary systems, or to disrupt business models and the financial and social worlds? From our perspective, it seems more likely that traditional business models will be slowly dismantled and replaced by new ones. On this basis, and with slow, perhaps somewhat subtle and boring changes, it is possible to achieve fundamental social change. It is the long-term horizon that is important, not the short-term.\n\nEstimating the potential of Cardano, and other projects are very difficult because we do not know the specific methods, speed, or form of disruption. All we have here and now is the current technology and its possibilities. So we can compare individual projects and estimate what is suitable for what and what form of disruption is possible. But possibility alone is certainly no guarantee of success. Success is almost always determined by multiple factors. Often the right time, place, and cost must meet. It may well be that we need more trials and iterations before mass adoption in any particular area can be achieved. Any failure can be seen as a failure of the whole technology, which can be a false impression. Conversely, partial successes may be overlooked or underestimated.\n\nCardano is just getting started in terms of releasing new features and other innovations. Many people often get stuck on the debate regarding, for example, the consensus algorithm. From the users\u2019 point of view, this is too technical and a completely unnecessary debate. Users want useful services or improvements and don\u2019t need to know the technological details. The important thing is to correctly name and analyze the current problems. Then we can consider whether they can be solved through decentralized technologies.\n\nAtala PRISM, a decentralized identity solution, is considered the 14th influential project out of 50 across various industries in 2020. Who would have thought 5 years ago that we would use blockchain in this way? Atala PRISM is being used by Ethiopia and a Fortune 250 company. Will others join in? How important will this technology be in finance? Who dares to guess the potential of this technology? Technological progress will only ever surprise us and the conclusions we draw today may be completely irrelevant tomorrow. Cardano will approach success slowly, step by step. It is necessary to see the process and future plans.", {"entities": [[16471, 16478, "crypto"], [16523, 16530, "crypto"], [16633, 16640, "crypto"], [17259, 17266, "crypto"], [17581, 17588, "crypto"], [20729, 20736, "crypto"], [20957, 20964, "crypto"], [30944, 30951, "crypto"], [31049, 31056, "crypto"], [31484, 31491, "crypto"], [31788, 31795, "crypto"], [49, 56, "crypto"], [8831, 8838, "crypto"], [12832, 12839, "crypto"], [15129, 15136, "crypto"], [17013, 17020, "crypto"], [17572, 17579, "crypto"], [20375, 20382, "crypto"], [20798, 20805, "crypto"], [26901, 26908, "crypto"], [27157, 27164, "crypto"], [28263, 28270, "crypto"], [28578, 28585, "crypto"], [29744, 29751, "crypto"], [30584, 30591, "crypto"], [31183, 31190, "crypto"], [31456, 31463, "crypto"], [31513, 31520, "crypto"], [31820, 31827, "crypto"], [32429, 32436, "crypto"], [32466, 32473, "crypto"], [35570, 35577, "crypto"], [36653, 36660, "crypto"], [36772, 36779, "crypto"], [37799, 37806, "crypto"], [38558, 38565, "crypto"], [39607, 39614, "crypto"], [20946, 20949, "crypto"], [35645, 35648, "crypto"]]}], ["Cardano Summit - Day 1 - Megathread - DiscussionHey all!\n\nWe are setting up a dedicated thread for both days for users taking part in the summit.\n\nIf you have not registered for the event do-so here: [https://summit.cardano.org/](https://summit.cardano.org/)\n\nAgenda here: [https://summit.cardano.org/agenda](https://summit.cardano.org/agenda)\n\nWe will be redirecting self posts to the main thread as it will help us properly organize and manage the board for the length of the event. \n\nI hope you all have fun!

Satoshi Nakamoto proved that it was possible to create decentralized value that people could own, share and transfer without a middleman. In doing so, he laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency industry, or if you prefer, blockchain networks. Every public blockchain network needs native coins to enable decentralization itself. Coins may play a different role in each project, but they have one thing in common. It is necessary to ensure their fair distribution.\n\nImagine you want to start a new decentralized project. What do you need? First of all, someone has to define the goals or mission of the project and its basic parameters. Then, some research and analysis will take place. This is followed by protocol implementation and launch. For many projects, the launch is just the beginning. No protocol in the world can ever be said to be fully complete. On the contrary, each protocol continues to be worked on and developed by a team or community. That said, the most important thing any protocol has is a team. Maintenance, improvements, and new features are never-ending jobs. If the protocol works well, it will find its users. As the number of users grows, the amount and scope of work on the protocol naturally increase.\n\nThe team must be paid for their work on the protocol. Some entity or body manages the work on the project and must secure funding. Thus, if a new decentralized project is created, some of the coins usually stay with a foundation or team for protocol development.\n\nWait a minute. How come we\u2019re talking about decentralization and some team is working on a protocol. Is this similar to, say, Microsoft working on the Windows operating system? There\u2019s no way it should be. Every blockchain project should be open source. The IOG team working on Cardano has all the source code public and also all the scientific studies. Nothing is patented. Everything belongs to the community as much as to the team.\n\nDecentralization at the team level is a difficult, if not impossible, thing. It is difficult to decentralize at this level because only a few people, often programmers, deal with a given protocol on a daily basis. Programming, networking, cryptography, and other things are too complex for ordinary people. There will always be a team behind the protocol. Even Bitcoin has a team. Satoshi Nakamoto abruptly left in silence but handed the project over to another programmer. The source code is on GitHub, people report bugs and the team fixes them and works on improvements. Trying to create governance where people understand the problems from the user side and express their opinion which is then implemented by the team is probably the best that can be achieved.\n\nWhat is important to us is not control over the source code of the protocol, but control over the network consensus and funding of the development. The team delivers new versions of the protocol and the people are the ones who are motivated to keep the network running. This is where we finally get to the debate about project coins.\n\nDecentralization at the network level is done via native coins. In the case of the Cardano protocol, ADA coins are used for this. This means that everyone who holds ADA coins is a so-called stakeholder. Such a person is actively involved in decentralization and network security. The way it works economically is that if there is demand for the coins, the coins have a market value. If a team or foundation also has coins, it has enough resources to develop the protocol. How does the team get to the coins? Either they keep a portion at the very beginning of the project launch, or they secure some stable income at the protocol level. Or some combination of both.\n\n## How to fairly launch a new project?\n\nHow to start a new project to make coin distribution fair? Clearly, at the source code level, each team can set up exactly what they need at the beginning. Of course, changes can occur in the protocol at any later time, but this should only be in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the community. This allows the team to decide at the beginning how many coins to keep for themselves, for their advisors, or to sell to seed investors. A part of the coins will then be sold publicly. Of course, not all of the coins that will always exist will be sold. Most protocols release new coins into circulation for a defined period of time, or forever. It depends on the monetary policy of each project.\n\nWhat is most important for a fair launch is a ratio between the coins that are sold to the public at launch and the coins that the team keeps. The team should strive to decentralize the protocol as much as possible. Thus, it cannot keep most of the coins for itself or for Venture Capital (VC). The team should only keep as much coin as is strictly necessary for the first years of the project\u2019s development. After that, it should secure funding through the collection of transaction fees and some form of decentralized management. We deliberately do not want to define some precise boundary as to when a launch is fair and when it is not. However, we believe that the team should keep less than half of the coins that will be in circulation. The rest of the coins should be sold publicly. Why? As we said, coin owners have control over the network consensus. If the team keeps most of the coins, it will of course also keep control of the network itself. In that case, it is not a decentralized network.\n\nThe network must be trustworthy right from the start. Trust in the network should grow over time. The team must not be able to manipulate either the network or the price of coins on the open market. If the majority of people trust the community and, by extension, the network, they buy the project\u2019s coins. The team must not be able to sell coins in bulk and thereby harm the community. The team should be transparent and publish the address where they keep the coins. This way the community can keep an eye on what is happening with the coins.\n\nThe team can keep the coins not only for development but also for other purposes. For example, as airdrops to get the coins out to the public. Also as rewards for those who do something useful for the ecosystem. The team can fund development from volunteers or third parties. However, everything should always be completely transparent and, most importantly, it must not come at the expense of decentralization.\n\nIs Bitcoin the fairest startup project? It\u2019s hard to say. Satoshi created Bitcoin before it launched, so he may have funded it himself. In the beginning, not many people knew about the project and Satoshi mined a high number of BTC coins himself. The problem is that today we don\u2019t know if anyone has access to the coins. The fate of the coins is unclear and shrouded in the belief that Satoshi will not spend his coins.\n\nUnfortunately, neither team probably has access to BTC coins. The funding of the Bitcoin project is not transparent. It would be better for Bitcoin if Satoshi gave the coins to the development team. If funding is not clear, teams may struggle to fund research and development. An organization may come in and subsidize only the development that is useful to them without any guarantee that it will also be useful to users. Bitcoin is said to change only slowly. This narrative can mask the fact that there is no funding for development. Development can only be afforded by developers who themselves own large amounts of BTC coins from the beginning of the era. Decentralization at the source code level is a difficult thing to tackle and the only way out is to strive for maximum transparency.\n\nBitcoin is fair in the sense that every single coin must be mined. No one could decide at the beginning to keep some of the coins for some use. That\u2019s certainly a nice thing. However, this approach is not possible today unless the project is to be a copy of an existing project. Today, the financing of the team must be taken into account in advance. This is the only way to fund new developments that move the whole industry forward. So the team is essentially doing the best they can. They offer their vision and then implement it.\n\nDigital coins only ever have the market value that people assign to them. The demand for coins reflects the quality of the project. People can judge the team, the partnership, the quality of decentralization, the security, the network capabilities, and many other things. In the beginning, only the vision may be available. In the cryptocurrency world, the quality of projects does not correspond to market capitalization. Some projects are overvalued, others undervalued. That\u2019s okay because people can\u2019t make good estimates of the potential of disruptive technologies.\n\nThe demand for coins is what will make it possible to fund development. People buy coins and thus give them value. Thus, the coins that are held by the team themselves also have value. The coin holders can be said to support the development of the project.\n\nAs we have already indicated, a rogue team can sell the coins, grab the money and disappear forever. People need to be aware of this risk before they buy coins. The longer a project exists and delivers promised features, the more likely it is to stay relevant. Of course, it\u2019s not just about creating the technology but seeking its adoption. A plan to create a strong community and real adoption must be part of the project. Neither community nor adoption can be bought. Both have to be worked on for the long term.\n\nCardano has been around since 2015. ADA coins entered the open market in 2017. The team has delivered a working PoS that has been running for over a year at the time of writing. Cardano also has smart contracts. So the team is gradually delivering on everything they promised and doing everything they can to make the development as transparent as possible. Anyone who is interested can follow the development in detail. Cardano definitely has one of the strongest communities in the cryptocurrency space. This is also a guarantee that the project is relevant and not going anywhere.\n\nSo how do you fairly launch a new blockchain project? It is fair to keep a reasonable amount of coins for the development of the project. However, most of the coins should be sold to the community on the open market. Subsequently, the team should be as transparent as possible about the disposition of its coins and development. It can be suspicious if the team does not communicate with the argument that they are trying to decentralize the project. The project should be as decentralized as possible at the network level and transparent at the development level.\n\nNote that team members can buy their own coins at the public sale. But that\u2019s very different from keeping them when you launch a project and then selling them. If they buy them like everyone else, they have to invest their own money in them. So they have skin in the game.\n\n## Cardano project coin distribution\n\nThe distribution of ADA coin vouchers took place in Asia in four stages between October 2015 and the start of January 2017. The team wanted to avoid potential future problems, so they followed the Know Your Customer guidelines. It was for the first time in the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, an audit was performed on the distribution process.\n\n25,927,070,538 ADA coins were sold to the public. In addition, the Genesis block distributed coins to 3 entities: Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG (IOHK). Cardano Foundation received 648,176,761 ADA, Emurgo received 2,074,165,644 ADA, and IOG received 2,463,071,701 ADA.\n\nThe sale made 108,844.5 BTC. Over 8,000 BTC was donated to the Cardano Foundation.\n\nAt project start, a total of 31,112,484,646 ADA was distributed. Since the launch of the PoS, new ADA coins have been gradually released into circulation. A further 13,887,515,354 ADA coins will gradually enter circulation until the maximum of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins is reached.\n\nWas the launch of the Cardano project fair? Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and IOG kept 20% of the ADA coins that were in circulation at launch. So 80% of the ADA coins were sold to the public. The network is 80% controlled by the public. Moreover, IOG does not operate its own staking pools. The team has plenty of funding for research and development. \n\n# What is the distribution of coins in other projects?\n\nAn interesting review was recently done by the Messari team. Cardano is one of the champions when it comes to fair coin distribution at launch. Many similar projects have publicly sold a relatively small amount of coins and the teams are still the majority owners of the projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jky51ri6od181.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fcbe73c37b0419ecf59314be5b224681bc63f53\n\n \n\nEach project has its own coin release strategy and its own reasons for retaining control of the network. The reasons can be quite pragmatic. As long as the team has control of the network, it cannot happen that the network is attacked by a 51% attack from the outside. The team can wait to sell the coins until it is sure that the coins will be distributed fairly among the people.\n\nThe distribution of coins will be lowest at the beginning and will increase over time. The opposite would be strange. If coins are used to distribute decision-making power, as in PoS networks, it is important that the number of coin holders grows. Ideally, there should not be many influential whales in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, no system can do without entities that hold large numbers of coins. It doesn\u2019t matter if they got the coins cheaply at the beginning or later. Anyone with enough money can become a whale in any ecosystem.\n\nIt is in the interest of the projects to spontaneously increase the number of coin holders. This is easier if the coins are in circulation from the start. It is likely that the whales will gradually sell their coins to newcomers. The value of the coins may fluctuate or even decline if the whales sell and there is no demand for the coins. It is always a good idea to look at the rich list to track the distribution of coins over time.\n\nIf a team holds, say, 80% of the coins and decides to sell a larger share, it is clear that the value of the remaining 20% of coins in circulation can drop dramatically. It is important to remember that the decision to sell is made by a single entity and one that knows exactly where the project stands.\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s case, stakeholders hold the coins for the most part, so they directly determine the value of ADA coins with their next purchase or sale. Importantly, the team, by the number of coins they hold, may not materially affect the value of the coins by their eventual sale. Moreover, if the team did so and moved the coins from their publicly available address, others would notice.\n\n## Coins and decentralization\n\nSatoshi\u2019s plan was that anyone could mine BTC coins. In the beginning, all you had to do was let your computer mine and after a while, you received a reward. This is an important principle. The opportunity to earn coins for doing important work for the network should be open to everyone as much as possible. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case with Bitcoin, as the cost of entry has increased and the environment is too competitive for everyone to succeed. PoW mining favors powerful entities more than domestic miners. As a result, interested parties have to buy BTC coins on the open market. Unfortunately, this does not decentralize the network, it only increases the price of coins. This increases the security budget, which is also important.\n\nCardano uses PoS in such a way that decentralization grows with the distribution of coins. Everyone likes to get rewards from staking, so you can basically earn coins in a very similar way to PoW mining. By holding and delegating coins to a pool for the network you are doing useful work. The coins in the staking are not available on the market, so this stabilizes their market value, which tends to rise. The growth in value of ADA coins sells 51% of the attack. Importantly, there is almost no entry cost. You just have to buy the coins. Anyone can do this according to their financial capabilities and preferences. No one is disadvantaged based on their location.\n\nAlmost no one knew about Bitcoin in the beginning, so maybe no one thought to invest in an attack. The network had little economic or social impact. Now it\u2019s different. Hackers are trying to attack every old and new network and make money from it. So a newly launched project has to be secure and economically hard to attack right from the start. When Cardano switched to PoS consensus, the coin distribution and market value were such that it was a safe move. There was a huge interest in running pools and staking, and that interest continues to this day. So the decentralization and security of the project are growing. This naturally also increases the confidence of newcomers in the project.\n\nPoW networks are not decentralized based on the number of coin holders. The coin distribution is only interesting from the perspective of being able to influence the value through large sales. Furthermore, the meaning of the coins themselves must be taken into account. For some projects, growth in the number of coin holders is more important than for other projects.\n\nThe current development of many projects is that coins can serve as a governance tool. This makes sense, as who else but the users themselves should be able to make requests and express their opinion on the team. The team should not be the one doing whatever it wants at a certain stage of the project. On the contrary, it should be an entity that is driven from the outside by the community. Getting to this state is extremely difficult, and fair coin distribution is an essential prerequisite. If the team holds the majority of the coins, it can make decisions on critical issues on its own.\n\nThe topic of decentralized project management is still in its infancy and not much is said about it. It is clear that the team needs to deliver some basic protocol functionality at the beginning and there is no point in talking too much about it. However, after some time the will of the community should have more strength. The team or community should propose changes and vote on them. The team will be in the role of executor of the will of the majority. As we said, decentralization at the team level is difficult, but that doesn\u2019t mean that teams won\u2019t pursue it. The use of coins seems logical.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the cryptocurrency space, you sometimes hear the opinion that it is impossible to fairly launch a new decentralized project. Many of these arguments don\u2019t make sense, and if you want to be critical, you will find problems with any project, including Bitcoin. Satoshi is not the only one who is a BTC whale. There may be more similar entities and their coins will be slow to enter circulation. Every project launch rewards those at the very beginning the most.

But let\u2019s not make an idol of one project and say that something can\u2019t be done again.\n\nCardano has had a fair coin distribution from the very beginning. Staking works on the basis of being able to buy ADA coins on the open market. You can\u2019t earn coins incrementally as you can with PoW networks. First, you have to have coins, then you can earn more as a reward. Buying ADA coins is your skin in the game. The coin distribution is dependent on network consensus, and the IOG team probably did it the best they could at the time.\n\nCardano\u2019s network is under stakeholder control and the team has minimal influence on the consensus. This cannot be said of other projects in many cases. Always be interested in how much control the team has over the coins. If it is high, consider well what that means for you. Venture Capital won\u2019t like Cardano because the community already owns it. Those who want a stake need to buy ADA coins on the open market.

Therefore, it makes sense to start with a disclaimer about me and my goals in making this post.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I don't care about price or market cap whatsoever, b/c I'm more interested in the technical future of this field than short-term moonshots; the only thing I care about are the technical claims made by formal research driven by the blockchains' respective foundations and the tradeoffs therein. I'm gonna be using my background knowledge in theoretical computer science and abstract math (which, of course, does not even *begin* to compare to that of Charles or Silvio) to make these comparisons, so I'll probably have to do a Satoshi and claim that \"if you're not gonna get it, then I don't have time to explain it to you\" (he allegedly said this on the forums in the early days of BTC.) My goal is to determine the most sound way of doing things in this field from a technical and formal mathematical perspective, so stick with me on this if and only if you're doing it for the tech.\n\nI'm gonna be comparing the following attributes of each cryptocurrency:\n\n1. Decentralization\n2. Scalability (both current and future outlook)\n3. Security guarantees\n4. Programmability of smart contracts and other on-chain user-programs\n5. Monetary policy\n6. Long-term goals and ecosystem culture\n7. Current and future use-cases\n\nLet's get started!\n\n**Decentralization (winner: tie)**\n\nFirst, we have to qualify how exactly we're measuring this; pretty much every competitor in this space is using this word in their marketing, but there's no objective way to compare the respective decentralization of two general blockchains. In the absence of a standard, I'm gonna go with the ones that are most important to me as a long-term investor:\n\n- Hardware requirements for a full-node (your own copy of the chainstate) and for a stake-pool (handling staking on your own computers without having to go through any third-party)\n- [Balaji Srinivasan's Nakamoto Coefficient](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e)\n\nStarting with ALGO, we first observe that there are multiple different kinds of nodes; you can either have a non-relay/non-archival node (the bare minimum you need to have your own independent copy of the chainstate), or you can provide features incl. relay and archiving optionally for rewards directly from the Foundation (there's no \"staking\" per se, all coins are pre-mined). The requirements to run a participation node (no special services and no rewards) are trivial -- it can be done on a Raspberry Pi -- but the requirements for archival and staking are two vCPU cores and 4GB RAM (roughly $20/mo. in the cloud).\n\nADA, on the other hand, requires roughly 8GB (16GB is recommended) of RAM to run a full-node (e.g., with Daedalus). For staking, you need 2 vCPU cores, 8GB of RAM, along with 1GB bandwidth per hour, and about 30GB of disk space to run the database -- all on a public/static IPv4 address. This will probably run you $20-40/mo. on a cloud provider.\n\nThe requirements for the two aren't all that different -- ADA's is slightly higher -- but I do want to note that Cardano is focused on lessening the barrier to adoption by relaxing the requirements to be part of the network, e.g., through [Mithril](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/), whereas ALGO qualifies that the requirements might increase over time. With that said, there isn't enough here to sweat it, as I'm sure ALGO will manage to keep the requirements low over time as well.\n\nRe. Nakamoto coefficient, you can refer to [the latest blockchain stats](https://adapools.org/groups) to see that we have roughly N=25 (higher is better). I'm not sure how to compute the same thing for ALGO from the metrics, but I'll hazard a guess that it's around the same. There's also the caveat that Nakamoto coefficient is expected to double for ADA when the K-parameter is relaxed in due time.\n\nI'm calling this a tie b/c ALGO seems _slightly_ more decentralized now, but ADA has a formal mathematical plan to become more decentralized as more stake is introduced.\n\n**Scalability (winner: ALGO, although it's close)**\n\nIt's really no competition here if you're considering TPS on the main-chain today; ALGO has TPS in the thousands, whereas ADA is upper-bounded at 4-6 TPS until the block size increases.\n\nWith that said, ADA does have an entire Basho era dedicated to securely offloading work onto sidechains, and Hydra is in the testing phase, so it's arguably apples to oranges; as Charles often argues, TPS is an oversimplification of the scalability problem b/c there's a difference between settlement on sidechains as opposed to on the main-chain (also discounting highly-complex transactions that can happen \"for free\" per block or even _between_ blocks).\n\nI think it suffices to say that ALGO is what is scalable **today**, whereas ADA has an entirely different approach to the whole scalability problem that we haven't even seen the beginning of yet. I'm calling this one in favor of ALGO gang, but it's really close, b/c we haven't seen anything from Basho yet.\n\n**Security guarantees (winner: tie)**\n\nTBH, both of these chains have pretty much the same cryptographic guarantees; in either case, you need a supermajority of the stake-holders to be honest in order for the chain to work.\n\nThe comparison is really between ALGO's cryptographic sortition for block production and ADA's Ouroboros protocol. I'm calling this a tie, b/c this is an _incredibly_ hard choice; while ALGO uses all kinds of fancy cryptographic primitives like VRFs, ADA has the Ouroboros protocol family, which gets more and more impressive to me with each new release.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Ouroboros is impressive to me b/c each generation builds on and strengthens the assumptions of the last to offer guarantees against different attack vectors; this is a DEEP rabbit hole to go down, but a sufficient TL;DR is that the latest generations -- Praos and Chronos -- are the first to formalize a notion of \"time\" on the blockchain so that attackers can't use real-time conditions induced by an evolving stakeholder population to exploit the system. With that said, this is all some silicon voodoo that 99% of you don't actually care about, so I'm not gonna give it to ADA b/c of this.\n\n**Programmability (winner: ADA)**\n\nThe background info here is that ALGO supports smart-contracts using Python or a JavaScript-like language called Reach, whereas ADA has its own Turing-complete programming language for smart contracts through Plutus (built on Haskell). Personally, I'm a huge fan of Haskell, along with other advancements in formal methods of programming language theory that ADA takes advantage of, but I'll try not to let that bias get to me.\n\nI'm giving it to ADA b/c, when you write a smart contract, you want as many formal guarantees provided by the system as possible (there's money on the line, and nobody wants to lose it). ALGO does better in this space than many other chains, having formal verification against things like memory leaks and integer/buffer overflows, but the formal methods supported by Haskell/Plutus in ADA are on a whole other league; you can mathematically _prove_ that the outcome of a smart contract is going to be one that is explicitly defined by the developer on Plutus, and you can similarly prove complex mathematical theorems using the underlying Haskell-based infrastructure. From the rigorous perspective of a computer scientist and a theoretical mathematician, ALGO provides the basics for you to avoid shooting yourself in the foot, whereas ADA changes the whole smart-contracts game.\n\n**Monetary Policy (winner: ADA)**\n\nIn this respect, ADA is a spiritual successor to Bitcoin, following the fixed-supply and halving cycles, whereas all ALGO is pre-mined and distributed to network participants by the Foundation.\n\nPersonally, I think monetary policy was one of the only things that Bitcoin did right; the point of this whole blockchain space, as it is, evolved from the idea of digital _scarcity_ in a _decentralized_ setting; ADA moves that foundation forward, whereas ALGO's monetary policy is effectively a centralization on the Foundation. I'm not saying this takes away from the decentralization of the chain itself -- otherwise, I'd have brought it up in the **Decentralization** section -- but I am qualifying that ALGO's decentralization depends on that of the Algorand Foundation (a legal entity operating as non-profit in either Switzerland or Singapore, I forget which) itself.\n\n**Long-term goals and ecosystem culture (winner: tie)**\n\nIt wouldn't really be fair of me to give this to one chain or another, as both communities have done great things for the advancement of the space, but I will say that I really appreciate the Cardano/Africa movement for bringing decentralization and security in the economic and legal systems to the people in the world who need it most. Algorand is probably doing something equally impressive on the nation-state side, but it sounds like Algorand is doing some [equally-impressive things](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/colombian-government-selects-vitalpass-as-nations-official-digital-vaccination-passport) to advance blockchain-driven solutions in developing nations.\n\nBoth Foundations are clearly very active and involved in the process of bringing blockchain to the third-world, so I can't ask for much more (at least not when the rest of the market has its money in meme coins).\n\n**Current and future use-cases (winner: ADA, but really close)**\n\nIt's a very close comparison b/c they have largely the same goals and a lot of similar technical foundations, but I'm giving it to ADA on the basis of Plutus being built specifically for high-assurance and high-complexity smart-contracts, whereas ALGO seems to be more geared for the average Joe developer. Again, I'm somewhat biased here as a Haskell-enthusiast, but as far as correctness-critical blockchain applications go (e.g., controlling the flight conditions of a plane in real-time on the blockchain,) you don't care how hard the programming language is to learn as long as you're sure the output is code that people can trust with pretty much theirs and their loved ones' whole lives.\n\nHopefully, it's clear why I'm claiming that Cardano is a better technical foundation for some things than Algorand is, but the approachability of Algorand development more than makes up for this in the short-term.\n\n**Conclusion (winner: tie)**\n\nThey're both brilliant projects brought to creation by the most gifted and technically-capable scientists and engineers of our generation; you can't really go wrong investing in either community and initiative. Personally, I'm a lot more bullish on ADA than this sub is when the price drops, but that's b/c I see it as a technical foundation of the likes of Algorand that is going to be the backbone of human interaction based on value, identity, and governance, for years to come.\n\nTL;DR: Any newcomer in this space should take a look at projects like these that expand the sphere of what is possible with the technological primitives rather than defaulting to BTC+ETH for long-term investments and memecoins for short-term speculation.", {"entities": [[7993, 8000, "crypto"], [8207, 8214, "crypto"], [1021, 1024, "crypto"], [11456, 11459, "crypto"], [11460, 11463, "crypto"], [3341, 3348, "crypto"], [9064, 9071, "crypto"], [10593, 10600, "crypto"], [30, 33, "crypto"], [167, 170, "crypto"], [2880, 2883, "crypto"], [3286, 3289, "crypto"], [4139, 4142, "crypto"], [4266, 4269, "crypto"], [4535, 4538, "crypto"], [4616, 4619, "crypto"], [5134, 5137, "crypto"], [5681, 5684, "crypto"], [5843, 5846, "crypto"], [6544, 6547, "crypto"], [6589, 6592, "crypto"], [6725, 6728, "crypto"], [6956, 6959, "crypto"], [7043, 7046, "crypto"], [7412, 7415, "crypto"], [7864, 7867, "crypto"], [7936, 7939, "crypto"], [7961, 7964, "crypto"], [8352, 8355, "crypto"], [9827, 9830, "crypto"], [9984, 9987, "crypto"], [11043, 11046, "crypto"]]}], ["\ud83d\udd39CardanoEvo | Holders were paid 50,000 ADA on Tuesday\ud83d\ude31 Did you get any? | Coinmarketcap Listed | Dex Launched | Branded Project | Audit passed | ADA Community following | Top Holders club\ud83d\udde3| A whole ecosystem of tokens | Merch.

Data is your friend.I'm going to show some data charts to Illustrate why ADA is doing well even though the price action (market chart) says other wise. On-chain metrics are the most data of any token; more important than the price of said token.\n\nTo clarify for the following pie chart: whales (wallets with more than 1% of total circulating supply), investors (wallets that have between 0,1% and 1% of total circulating supply) and retail (wallets that have less than 0,1% of the total circulating supply)\n\nHere I'm comparing holders of ETH and ADA, as ETH is the closest token to ADA.\n\nSo here is the chart from ADA\n\n[ Whales: 6&#37;. Investors: 22&#37;. Retail: 72&#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/eajfv6goet081.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37ad9697ee76155fcfe1ef37b6502785473da6)\n\nAnd for a comparison, I'm going to show ETH stats.\n\n[ Whales: 21&#37;. Investors 20&#37;. Retail: 59&#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/6xk2uz4ret081.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f4dfb9fa9cdf2b64629770a16f93c565d080c77)\n\nComparing the holders of ADA and ETH it's interesting that the number of Investors are the same, while ADA has 70% less whales holding the token. In addition, the market cap of ADA is 12% the market cap of ETH (ETH : 523bn. ADA : 62bn).\n\nNow if we compare the ratio of market cap to the ratio of whales we get:\n\n* ADA market cap / ETH market cap = 62/523 = 0.12\n* ADA whales / ETH whales = 6/21 = 0.29\n\nThis I believe is bullish because whale ratio is higher than market cap ratio by 240%, which means there are more whales for a relatively smaller market cap project. This is my interpretation of this data so take it with a grain of salt ,and there are various ways of interpreting this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lets look at **long term holders** (holding for more than 1 year+) and the number of these addresses\n\n[ May 2.78b ADA. Oct 6.34b ADA. Nov \\(month not over\\) 6.63b ADA ](https://preview.redd.it/k9xxevowet081.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ac0e053c1fe0b9d35dc4c15de63d3c473802a6d)\n\nAs we can see whales have been accumulating for the past 7 months, with an increase in 245% owned by whales. In addition, the number of addresses have gone from 167k to 258k, meaning more whales are coming into ADA. Both of these signals are bullish.\n\n[Source](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ADA/deep-dive?group=ownership&chart=all)  (Sorry, but you have to create an account to view the data. You can start a 7 day trial with no credit card requirement, unlike some other sites. There are other sites to access this data as well. I'm not affiliated with Intotheblock, but it's the best site I've found for free data)\n\n**In conclusion or TL;DR**: ADA has strong on-chain metrics, so don't be fouled by the 40% drop since ATH. ADA takes time to consolidate after massive rallies, like the one in august, the one from december 2020 to March 2021 and the one from March 2020 to August 2020. In the crypto market patience is one of the most valuable assets.\n\nNote: I currently hold ADA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: I see there is a lot of hate on ADA and that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. One thing I think a lot of people don't have clear is that Cardano is a peer reviewed project, so things take longer to launch, but have a high chance of success when they are launched. Also, if you think this ecosystem doesn't mean anything, then by all means, hate on the token.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcz3rdjnlt081.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c30892afdfff842d42f1ecfba3ac4ce8411d3bfe", {"entities": [[574, 577, "crypto"], [590, 593, "crypto"], [870, 873, "crypto"], [1090, 1093, "crypto"], [1263, 1266, "crypto"], [1268, 1271, "crypto"], [1388, 1391, "crypto"], [1434, 1437, "crypto"], [3212, 3219, "crypto"], [31, 34, "crypto"], [109, 112, "crypto"], [582, 585, "crypto"], [618, 621, "crypto"], [650, 653, "crypto"], [1082, 1085, "crypto"], [1160, 1163, "crypto"], [1234, 1237, "crypto"], [1281, 1284, "crypto"], [1371, 1374, "crypto"], [1421, 1424, "crypto"], [1876, 1879, "crypto"], [1891, 1894, "crypto"], [1925, 1928, "crypto"], [2261, 2264, "crypto"], [2345, 2348, "crypto"], [2700, 2703, "crypto"], [2779, 2782, "crypto"], [3031, 3034, "crypto"], [3089, 3092, "crypto"]]}], ["Where are all my fellow frustrated ADA holders?", {"entities": [[35, 38, "crypto"]]}], ["ADA", {"entities": [[0, 3, "crypto"]]}], ["Will ADA cater to ETH migrants?I am someone who has had a few hundred locked in a well known layer 1 defi platform for nearly a year.

Everyone here needs to understand the security risks with ADA's smart contracts are not FUD.Tldr: This isn't debatable: ADA will not have defi until they deploy a sidechain or other solution that has not yet been developed, let alone tested. Telling people \"it's okay, don't worry about this FUD\" will directly cause people to lose serious amounts of money. Everyone needs to understand the additional risks they will be taking on if they use centralized \"defi\" on cardano. \n\n\nThis is not FUD; this is a serious problem. The cardano chain absolutely cannot run a uniswap DEX. That's bad, but the real problem is that everyone, including devs [learning plutus ](https://plutus-pioneer-program.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pioneer/week10.html), are actively being misinformed by cardano's leadership. \n\n\nThe problem is fundamental to cardano's eUTXO architecture. In plutus, every AMM pool has an NFT that must be referenced to create a tx on the exchange. And, every tx writes over that pool NFT with an updated NFT that reflects the current state of the pool. Every tx must create a new pool NFT, and no txs can call the previous NFT.\n\nIn UTXO all txs are deterministic. That means that if you and me both call the existing NFT pool for our tx, only one of our txs will be completed. I can't reference the pool NFT if it doesn't exist anymore, because you beat me to it. My tx will fail, and I will have to call the new NFT that your tx created. \n\nSo, you can code a Uniswap AMM program, and everything will look completely fine as long as one person trades at a time. When 50 people attempt to interact with it (within the amount of time it takes to query the state of the pool, consider accepting the exchange rate, and actually submitting a tx), 49 of their txs will fail, and you will soon have a pile up with thousands of txs failing for every one tx that succeeds. Realistically, the pool will change before most people even attempt to submit the tx, causing it to immediately fail.\n\nThat's why it currently is not possible to run a DEX on cardano. DEXs will have to be run on non-eutxo sidechains or use other methods that have not been fully tested yet. This is a PITA, but the real problem is the workaround solutions that are going to be implemented. The ADA community's (and Charles' very intentional) misrepresentation of the issue is going to end disastrously.\n\nhttps://medium.com/occam-finance/the-occam-fi-technical-series-on-concurrency-cd5bee0b850c\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ErgoDex/status/1434241109283287041?s=20\n\nhttps://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/concurrency-state-cardano-c160f8c07575\n\n\nSidechain and decentralized solutions to this problem do exist, but none of them have been developed or tested yet. Sundaeswap claims to have a secret solution, but it's really not possible that they have a decentralized solution ready to go. \n\nThere is a HUGE difference between going \"off-chain\" to a decentralized sidechain and going \"off-chain\" through a centralized, trusted custodian (even if they route your tx to another decentralized chain). Charles knows this, and he also knows that you don't. \n\nThis means, that for the time being, cardano will not have decentralized exchanges, and because of the community's refusal to acknowledge and honestly address this conversation, most ADA users will have no understanding of the vulnerabilities these centralized  exchanges represent.\n\nUntil this problem is solved, treat every cardano \"DEX\" like a \"CEX.\" Do not leave large amounts of money in their SCs. There will be DEXs that pop up and offer great APRs using the same code as well-known projects, but they will exit scam. People will exploit this. Cardano should delay smart contracts until this is resolved. This will make cardano the riskiest chain for defi.\n\nEdit: I cannot comment, message or post on reddit anymore because the cardano sub reported this post as harassment and my account is suspended (this post started as a comment, replying to a post on their sub).", {"entities": [[3705, 3712, "crypto"], [102, 105, "crypto"], [164, 167, "crypto"], [2305, 2308, "crypto"], [3337, 3340, "crypto"]]}], ["Comparing AMP to ADA's Chart&#x200B;\n\n[ADA Price](https://preview.redd.it/1btzpj77w5181.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=5412f13c01472d33c8c9fc432f498ac9f13ad609)\n\nAfter deleting a post where I failed to be funny, I invite you to look at my new post.

Certain Cardano parameters, mainly block size and block time, can be tweaked to increase network throughput, but that can only get them so far, with some estimating the limit to be around 50 TPS, with an assumption of ~450 bytes per transaction. \n\nAlso, due to increased transaction sizes because of smart contracts, Cardano blocks are consistently filling up with well below 100 transaction right now, and that will only get worse as a higher percentage of transactions include larger smart contracts. Over the past hour or so, the average transaction size is closer to 700 bytes and my bet would be that we'll see that trend towards 1000. Thus, the theoretical limit of transaction speed without L2 scaling is closer to 25 TPS. \n\nThis is all to say - Cardano is heading toward a congestion crisis. Cardano developers are talking about implementing something similar to ETH gas fees as a way to prioritize transactions. Either cardano transaction fees will start to trend up significantly, or the chain is going to be overly congested.\n\nSo, why am I posting this here, in /r/ergonauts ?\n\nAs we all probably know, ERG has close ties with Cardano. Instead of going down with the ship and blindly defending Cardano in light of  its shortcomings, how can ERG position itself to benefit from this congestion? How can ERG be there to support Cardano and serve as an overflow settlement layer? ErgoDEX seems like the best short-term candidate, as DEX's are sure to require many transactions. \n\nWill it be possible to swap cardano native assets on the ERG side of ergoDEX? We talk often about interoperability through Gravity, but what is the current status of Ergo interoperability with Cardano? This could be an extremely convincing selling point versus other Cardano DEX's that will be forced to settle on Cardano, and could facilitate a ton of adoption from the Cardano community who, if they are anything like us, will be hooked after looking into and actually using ERG. While most cardano DEX's are thinking about ways to port coins from other chains onto cardano, ERG can do that as well as provide an alternative settlement layer for Cardano assets - it seems like a no brainer and something that we should be aggressively pursuing. And it is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nErgo has a great team and community, and I want to start these discussions now so that there is time to build the necessary solutions. \n\nLooking forward to some discussion on this topic.", {"entities": [[1590, 1593, "crypto"], [121, 128, "crypto"], [433, 440, "crypto"], [664, 671, "crypto"], [727, 734, "crypto"], [1036, 1043, "crypto"], [1472, 1479, "crypto"], [1519, 1526, "crypto"], [1857, 1864, "crypto"], [1924, 1931, "crypto"], [2056, 2063, "crypto"], [2400, 2407, "crypto"], [2474, 2481, "crypto"], [2521, 2528, "crypto"], [2578, 2585, "crypto"], [2855, 2862, "crypto"], [42, 45, "crypto"]]}], ["I made an ADA CalculatorI like to have some idea of the value of the ADA I hold 5-10 years from now so I often use savings calculators with 4-5% APY to simulate the increase of ADA gained from staking.

Everyone knows the phrase \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d. This also applies to ADA coin staking. Learn why it\u2019s better to stake ADA coins from your own wallet. \n\n# Centralization is dangerous\n\nPeople have bad habits because they use traditional banking. Therefore, they do not need to own their money and entrust it to banks. People believe that when they need money they can use it through credit cards or internet banking. In most cases, this works well. The problem is that people apply the same pattern of behavior to cryptocurrencies. They trust centralized exchanges to own the coins if they have them in their account. People assume that the legal system will protect their cryptocurrency wealth in a similar way that it would protect them in the case of fiat money. There are several problems with this thinking.\n\nCentralization offers people convenient and easy-to-use services. However, this is probably the only advantage. Everything else tends to be disadvantageous for users. Centralized services represent a single point of failure. Remember when Facebook stopped working for a few hours? People basically couldn\u2019t communicate with their environment. Exactly the same thing can happen with your money. You don\u2019t have to have it available when you need it. Many exchanges may not be as well protected as banks. Hackers can attack them and steal cryptocurrencies. If this happens, the exchange will probably go out of business, but you may never see your cryptocurrency. In the past, we\u2019ve seen cases where the exchange owner himself has stolen cryptocurrencies and disappeared. Let\u2019s not forget that regulations are still not completely friendly to cryptocurrencies in all countries. There could be a black scenario where cryptocurrencies are seized by the government. It is common for an exchange to unexpectedly announce maintenance and not allow you to send coins from the exchange. Or they charge fees that are more expensive than the current ones on the blockchain. Losing user data, misusing it, or even selling it on purpose is also not uncommon, and we\u2019ve seen this with the aforementioned Facebook.\n\nIn addition to these technical problems, there is also an ideological problem. Cryptocurrencies are here to rid us of these centralized centers of power. If we are serious about cryptocurrency adoption and paradigm shift, we must first and foremost change our established patterns of behavior. People need to educate themselves, install their own cryptocurrency wallets, and actually own cryptocurrencies by holding private keys. Simply put, anyone who does not have coins on their hardware wallet is not a cryptocurrency user but a speculator.\n\nPeople must learn to own and use their wealth without relying on middlemen. Decentralized networks allow you to send coins and tokens anywhere in the world. Cardano will soon allow you to own not only coins and tokens but also your identity with all the associated data. It will even allow you to trade, take out loans, insurance, and use other financial services. All in a completely decentralized way. You won\u2019t be able to take advantage of any of this unless you learn to own coins.\n\nThe decentralization of the Cardano network is based on the distribution of ADA coins among users. Whoever owns an ADA coin also owns a proportional part of the Cardano network. Coin ownership is thus quite crucial. A portion of the coins will always be on centralized exchanges because people want to speculate with them. That is what is counted on. People who want to hold coins for the long term should withdraw their coins from the exchanges to their own wallets. The important thing to say is that you can stake ADA coins from your own wallet and you don\u2019t need the exchanges to do that at all.\n\n# Stake from your own wallet is always the most advantageous\n\nCardano arguably has the best staking capabilities among the competition. Cardano staking does not lock coins for any time period. This gives you complete freedom to decide how to use and spend them. Do you want to lock coins in the DeFi service or buy something with them? You can do that at any time. Centralized exchanges often don\u2019t offer you this option and require you to lock coins. The Cardano protocol does not require this. Exchanges do. As we mentioned, exchanges can be hacked. We believe you can protect your ADA coins better than exchanges. Cardano distributes rewards to all stakeholders every 5 days. Exchanges can do this over a longer period of time. In addition, Cardano does not charge any fees. The business model of the exchanges has to work somehow. Exchanges are always profit-oriented and will want to be paid somehow for the services they provide. If they offer you a higher interest rate than Cardano\u2019s protocol, be interested in how it works in the background and if the model is sustainable in the long term. Cardano has a unique model that does not use slashing. This means that delegators will never lose coins due to pool operator misconduct. The Cardano protocol protects stakeholders as much as possible, so it makes no sense to expose yourself to danger through centralized exchanges.\n\nIn the Cardano ecosystem, there is not even a limit to the number of coins you have to own. People often use exchanges for staking just because some protocol forces them to own a certain amount of native coins. People who hold small amounts of coins, therefore, need to pool somewhere, and exchanges are happy to take advantage of this need. This is not the case in the Cardano network. All you need is a small amount of ADA coins and you can participate in staking. There is no need to find other people with small amounts of coins and pool the coins together to get the necessary amount for staking. A small amount of ADA coins can be delegated directly from your wallet to the selected pool. You don\u2019t need to trust middlemen or anyone else in your area.\n\nWhat\u2019s best for you is also best for decentralizing the Cardano network. We mentioned the basic cryptocurrency lesson in the introduction. Not your keys, not your coins. You only hold the keys if you have the coins in your own wallet. If you have coins on the exchange, the exchange holds the keys. You only hold the passwords to log into the exchange, at best 2FA authentication. Many people have lost their cryptocurrencies just because they didn\u2019t secure their access to the exchange well. This is another attack vector that is completely unnecessary in a world of decentralization. The Cardano network will become more decentralized the more users realize this and actively support it. The team has managed to beautifully align the needs of the network with the mission of the entire crypto industry.\n\n# What does it mean to hold ADA?\n\nOwning ADA coins is different than owning BTC coins. Leaving BTC coins on an exchange does not directly reduce the decentralization of the network. In the case of Cardano, the centralized exchanges are essentially intermediary owners of the network. From the perspective of the legal system, the owners of the ADA coins are the people that purchased them. From the perspective of being able to use the coins for staking, for example, to choose the pool to which the coins will be delegated or to vote in Catalyst, the centralized exchanges hold those rights.\n\nOf course, you have to take into account the misuse of coins for a 51% attack. Centralization is always dangerous in terms of abuse of power. On the other hand, large exchanges have a vested financial interest in maintaining a profitable business. For example, if 10 centralized exchanges held say 15% of the coins used for staking, this would not pose a significant threat. 15% of the coins is insufficient for an attack, and it is safe to assume that a larger number of exchanges would not work together in terms of an attack. You could even say that 15% of the coins are well protected by teams that know how to do their jobs very well. It is unlikely that hackers would be able to hack 10 exchanges at the same time. The coins on the exchanges are kept in cold storage, so they are well protected. While it is always better to have multiple independent entities holding a given amount of coins rather than one large one, this is not necessarily as bad as many people think. With increasing adoption and awareness, it can be assumed that people will eventually transfer the coins from the exchanges into their wallets. If someone manages to hack an exchange, it can scare people and speed up the process.\n\nLet us ask ourselves an almost philosophical question. Who actually owns the blockchain network? No one, because we are in a decentralized world? If no one owned it, someone would appropriate the network. If everyone collectively owned the network, we would have to ask what specific rights that give us. In the software world, there will always be someone who decides to modify the source code. At this point, decentralization can only work to a limited extent. Cardano gives you a voice through the ownership of coins. ADA coin owners can make decisions about the future development of the ecosystem and, in time, the protocol itself. People will thus be able to decide what modifications to the protocol will take place. The team will thus be fulfilling the contract of the majority of owners.\n\nHowever, the protocol cannot be said to be owned by the team through the source code. The distributed network code itself is not worth anything. What has value are the people who run the client and are actively involved in running the network. What is valuable to the user is the ability to create, maintain, transmit, and otherwise use digital value or establish trust between participants. It is critically important for the network to be able to produce new blocks. Thus, the network could be said to be owned by all those involved in the process. In the Cardano ecosystem, the network is owned by the pool operators and delegators. ADA coins provide critical decision rights about who will operate the pool. If you have these decision rights, we can say that you are the owners or operators. Coins are a means of control over the network.\n\nIf we ask a similar question in the case of PoW networks, we get a slightly different answer. The means of control in PoW networks is electricity. ASIC miner operators can decide to which pool they delegate their computing power. Of course, they will choose a pool that behaves fairly and runs a version of the client that satisfies the power provider. Note that coins are not a means of control anyway, but only a means of reward.\n\nFinancial reward is very important as it is a strong incentive to behave honestly. In PoS networks, coins are a means of control but also a means of reward. If you participate in staking, you earn regular rewards. As a coin owner, you want to appreciate your wealth. You have a direct incentive to see that the protocol evolves, that blocks produce honest pools, and that decentralization is maximized.\n\nIn PoW networks, control is more about business than building an ecosystem with democratic principles. Of course, PoW miners also want the protocol to do well and develop. However, miners can only take into account their selfish interests and these may not be in line with the coin holders, i.e. the users of the network. What is unique about the Cardano network is that all users of the network can simultaneously be owners of the network if they want to. They can even profit from the success of the network through regular rewards. PoS allows the infrastructure to be decentralized at a very high level and pool operators and all delegators can participate.\n\nIf you own ADA coins, you are actively supporting the creation of a decentralized ecosystem that can be used by other people on the planet. Even those who don\u2019t own ADA coins will be able to send stable coins, NFTs, or other tokens over the network. People should realize that holding coins on exchanges prevents the full development of the decentralization ideal.\n\n# Trusted and untrusted delegation of power\n\nIn any decentralized ecosystem, there is the possibility to delegate decision-making power. This possibility is either directly supported by the protocol from the original design, or arises organically somehow. What does it actually mean to delegate decision-making power? In any network, there are a limited number of entities that produce blocks. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are called pools or validators. What matters is that these entities must satisfy some protocol conditions and must have a certain size of a given resource. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are coins in the case of PoS or energy in the case of PoW. Cardano has used the concept of pools from the very beginning. Bitcoin came to this organically over time and Satoshi doesn\u2019t mention them in the white paper. Pools can decide whether to produce a block, what transactions to include in it, what block to continue on in case of a fork, and so on. Block producers make decisions that cannot be made by those who delegate power to these pools through coins or energy. You could say that delegators can only control the work of pools.\n\nThe delegation of decision-making power, or if you prefer, the delegation of control, is a very important process in terms of decentralization. We can divide this activity into two categories:\n\n* A trusted delegation is one in which the choice of the delegator cannot be influenced or changed by a third party. This means that the delegator itself directly decides which pool it delegates coins or energy to. If there is any problem with a pool, the delegator can immediately change his choice. This weakens the rogue pool and strengthens another pool that is behaving fairly.\n* An untrusted delegation is a delegation in which the owners of the resources use the services of third parties. This means that the resource owners do not have direct control over their choice. They may express their wishes, but the third party is one that carries out the will of the delegator and may or may not comply. If there is a sudden problem the delegators do not have full control over the delegation and cannot react quickly by delegating to another pool if necessary. Third parties may misuse the provided resource for an attack, the resource may be stolen, or the resource may somehow be prevented from being used.\n\nClearly, the ecosystem should support the existence of trusted delegation as much as possible. Untrustworthy delegation is a threat to decentralization. Let\u2019s show examples.\n\nStaking through a centralized exchange is a typical example of untrusted delegation. People entrust coins to the exchange and the exchange stakes the coins for them. Exchanges set up their own pools and use users\u2019 coins to do so. The exchange thus holds a lot of power in the network, but the skin in the game is still held by the owners of the coins, not the exchange itself. Even if a centralized exchange has an economic incentive to behave fairly, and we can imagine that some trouble with lawyers might result from an abuse of power, prevention is always the best defense against abuse of power.\n\nPoW networks suffer from the same problem. People are not always able to get a good price for power and are forced to run their mining through third parties. Large third parties always have an advantage against small miners as they can negotiate better prices for energy as large buyers, also when buying ASIC equipment, and even smaller fees from pools. Cloud mining is therefore relatively widespread. Genesis Mining claims on its website that up to 2 million customers use its services. People pay for the hash rate through their bank account, but the cloud mining companies are the ones who decide what to do with the hash rate or whether to abuse this power.\n\nIn the case of PoW mining, people often do not have the option to use trusted delegation. This means that power is centralized in the hands of third parties. In the case of Cardano, however, there is nothing stopping people from delegating from their own wallets. It costs nothing to delegate coins, and it\u2019s just the same expensive anywhere in the world. There is no rational reason for people to leave coins on exchanges. People just need to understand the basic rules of staking and delegation to do without exchanges and untrusted delegation entirely.\n\nSooner or later, strong players will dominate every ecosystem. The protocol must be well prepared for this eventuality and ideally support greater decentralization, even at the cost of major changes at the first layer. The Binance exchange has roughly a 10% share of power at the block producer level in both the Cardano ecosystem and Bitcoin. This is hard for the community to resist and it would be naive to somehow prohibit it. In the case of Bitcoin, the Binance exchange is likely to have its own hash rate, as what miner would delegate power to a pool of a centralized exchange? Many such people probably wouldn\u2019t. In the case of the Cardano ecosystem, however, people can leave the exchange and run staking completely freely and independently of a third party. The Binance exchange certainly doesn\u2019t own 10% of the ADA coins.\n\nLet\u2019s add that not every PoS network allows delegation of power to pools. If a certain high number of coins is needed for staking, exchanges or other more centralized solution is the only option for smaller holders. These networks can also slide towards untrusted delegation. Cardano has delegation built right into the protocol and you can literally delegate with a few coins. Thus, nothing stands in the way of decentralization.\n\n# It is all about trust\n\nThe concept of decentralization is built on the distribution of trust. Instead of centralized entities, people can trust a large group of independent entities. For end-users, this means they trust the network, not anyone in particular. As decentralization begins to be explored more in the media, the number of pools or delegators in given ecosystems will be compared. As adoption grows, the demand for more decentralization will grow. This is logical if decentralized networks will have higher financial and social relevance. Decentralization must grow over time not stagnate or even decline.\n\nIf there are strong actors with a lot of power in a decentralized ecosystem, this will be a problem. Because there will be increasing pressure on these entities and many people will want to somehow control them, abuse them, or perhaps destroy them. The point of decentralization is about maximizing the distribution of power because that is the only way a given network can survive.\n\nThe success of the networks will be directly dependent on the network effect and the people who choose to use the blockchain network. The quality of decentralization will definitely be an important parameter in the decision-making process. Although we believe that decentralization is not the most important attribute from the users\u2019 perspective, it is still what differentiates Cardano or Bitcoin from centralized services. Let\u2019s never forget that. Imagine if a network was in the hands of 3 large pools and 100 large delegators of power. How are you going to convince other people on the planet that the rules of the network won\u2019t change? People need to be assured that the fundamental rules of the network will either never change, or only through a transparent majority decision. If people don\u2019t have a vote, the decentralized network will end up just like a regular bank or a big IT company. Top management will make the decisions.\n\nWe can revisit our philosophical question about who actually owns the network. We said above that it\u2019s largely about who controls the network at the consensus or source code level. For all users, the choice of the network will be an absolutely critical decision, as they will entrust their wealth to it. These users must have confidence that the network is either partially owned by themselves or, conversely, not owned by a few powerful players. If the network is abandoned by users, the network itself will lose its meaning. If the \u201cin code we trust\u201d narrative is to succeed, users must be convinced that the network is truly decentralized and not in the hands of a few powerful actors. In other words, if a user sends a transaction, they must have 100% confidence that the network will process the transaction without delay. Any other outcome may be an indication of centralization.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDecentralization is a moving target. Powerful actors will seek to dominate the network, whether for economic or other reasons. We have no historical experience of sustaining decentralization and we are only at the beginning. The Cardano protocol is designed to allow trusted delegation. That is, it allows you to delegate small amounts of ADA coins from your own wallet. This process is as simple and cheap as possible. You can delegate ADA coins from the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet. There is no reason to leave coins on centralized exchanges. If you want to rely on exchanges, it is always better to split the coins across multiple exchanges so that they are not held by a single entity. However, you always risk losing your coins and there is a potential risk of misuse.\n\nThird parties will always be happy to offer their services because they can profit from them. To profit, their economic model must be better than the decentralized network model itself. This is theoretically impossible without risking coins or misusing your data. Third parties will offer not only staking but also, for example, cheap sending of coins over centralized networks. Although it is user-friendly to pay with a crypto card in a store, be aware that this has its negatives in terms of the sustainability of the first-layer economic model. For the networks themselves, only those transactions that earn fees are useful. The fees are used to reward stakers or miners. Thus, teams must strive for technological advances that allow coins to be used in a completely decentralized way while achieving high user-friendliness. This is a big challenge and it won\u2019t do without second layers. The first and second layers should thus be economically linked.\n\nCryptocurrencies are primarily there to change the existing order. If you stake in the exchanges, buy an HW wallet and send your ADA coins there. You\u2019ll support the decentralization of the Cardano network and protect your coins much better at the same time.", {"entities": [[12903, 12910, "crypto"], [16864, 16871, "crypto"], [16975, 16982, "crypto"], [19189, 19196, "crypto"], [6945, 6948, "crypto"], [6964, 6967, "crypto"], [2990, 2997, "crypto"], [3348, 3355, "crypto"], [3481, 3488, "crypto"], [3983, 3990, "crypto"], [4057, 4064, "crypto"], [4377, 4384, "crypto"], [4538, 4545, "crypto"], [4665, 4672, "crypto"], [4903, 4910, "crypto"], [5021, 5028, "crypto"], [5162, 5169, "crypto"], [5311, 5318, "crypto"], [5674, 5681, "crypto"], [6119, 6126, "crypto"], [6653, 6660, "crypto"], [7066, 7073, "crypto"], [9135, 9142, "crypto"], [10028, 10035, "crypto"], [11498, 11505, "crypto"], [12840, 12847, "crypto"], [16145, 16152, "crypto"], [16842, 16849, "crypto"], [17169, 17176, "crypto"], [17639, 17646, "crypto"], [19178, 19185, "crypto"], [20867, 20874, "crypto"], [22565, 22572, "crypto"], [13, 16, "crypto"], [244, 247, "crypto"], [293, 296, "crypto"], [3396, 3399, "crypto"], [3435, 3438, "crypto"], [3837, 3840, "crypto"], [4505, 4508, "crypto"], [5725, 5728, "crypto"], [5924, 5927, "crypto"], [6897, 6900, "crypto"], [6910, 6913, "crypto"], [7213, 7216, "crypto"], [9193, 9196, "crypto"], [10106, 10109, "crypto"], [11824, 11827, "crypto"], [11978, 11981, "crypto"], [17351, 17354, "crypto"], [20977, 20980, "crypto"], [21075, 21078, "crypto"], [22505, 22508, "crypto"]]}], ["I\u2019m a big fan of ADA, but I\u2019m a little concerned about the lack of dapps right now\u2026 what milestones are important to you guys in the next 1-3 months\u2026?", {"entities": [[17, 20, "crypto"]]}], ["AdaApe | Auto ADA rewards \ud83d\udcb0| weekly Prize Giveaways \u203c\ufe0f | ownership going to be renounced \u2705 | BIG marketing starting!

If XRP's goal is to be a currency bridge to eliminate foreign exchange and make it easy to swap currency, why isn't it a stable coin like USDT? Many on here are throwing out ridiculous numbers like $30k and above. Even $100 seems insane to me as it's purpose isn't even to be a stand alone currency. For example what would be the purpose of having a $30K XRP coin when it's just going to be converted into a Swiss Frank immediately or US dollar? Or what would even be the benefit of having a $10 coin if it's sole purpose is just to be converted? I feel like all it is is being treated like a stock similar to what the SEC is saying. I don't understand why XRP's value goes up or why people would even need to buy this coin as they plan to work with banks as a form of exchange. Maybe I just don't fully understand, but if you can explain it to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Also if any of you have any information about the team behind it that would be appreciated as well.

As a result, she now has a large scar over on the left side of her face and keeps her left eye closed at all times. Her outfit still remains the same though, due to the rules of becoming a Magical Girl.Deep down, Ripple also has a somewhat childish side, as shown when she made her Magical Girl character a ninja because she thought it looked \"cool\". However, she doesn't want anyone to know about this side of her and skillfully hides it. Her Specialty:\n\n4-Dimensional XRP Bag: A magical bag. Not limited to objects, as living things can be packed into it, too. It's more of a bag rather than a pocket. Ripple took it after killing Calamity Mary.\n\nRippleGirl is a newly launched token on the BSC. The aim of the token is pure fun and rewards. RippleGirl has a super low buy and sell tax of 8% of which 4% goes to XRP rewards and 4% goes to marketing. 40% of the supply has already been burned. All funds raised so far have been sent out to influencers, call groups and the best investors in the BSC. There are fun contests where the community wins BNB as well. It's an excellent hang with some excellet gains and a solid, based team.\n\nThe team has launched many legitimate tokens on the BSC with great Dapps, this is strictly a fun rewards play by the team. With super SAFU coding to make the investor secure in their investment. The team always delivers on their promises, feel free to stop by the telegram group to see the proof of how the marketing funds are used and everyone's huge bag of XRP rewards.\n\nWhy have a play that's just fun with no use case? Because we're all here to have a good time. Each one of these tokens is like its own little country with it's own curreny and we want you to belong to our country. Come be a part of the RippleGirl community. We're brining the BSC back to what it once was community based rewards tokens, with straight forward tokenomics and a transparent team. Come make a suggestion and help the community to reach new heights never seen before in the BSC. The community is already super solid and enjoying the token.\n\nMany low MC plays try to simply take their investors with crazy tokenomics that cost high transaction fees and high tax for buys and sells. It's hard to feel safe when you're paying a super high percentage in and out. This is simple and straight forward, without those crazy high transaction fees and solid XRP rewards.\n\nRewards tokens inherently cause red candles to sell tokens fo rth rewards. The developers have combatted this with innovative rewards functions that optimize both gas and selling pressure on the chart. Rewards are on a volume and holdeings based payout schedule. As usual a holder can interact with the contract in anyway to receive rewards as well. (buy/trade/sell)\n\nWhat Marketing? Come join our VC where we discuss every marketing technique we us ein detail with many influencers right in the voice chat. Transparency is of the upmost importance to us. Prelaunch we had our graphics designer pop out some great jpegs and 25 animated stickers.

If so, what's the most cost effective way to do so?I've been using the 18v XRP ni-cad batteries since the turn of the century (I used to be a cableguy in my former life).  I've got 2 drills, a hammer drill, and a circular saw that I use for small projects around the home.  My batteries are holding less and less charge and it's probably time to replace them.  I typically just buy a 3/8 inch drill kit with 2 batteries and a charger and that gets me by for another 5 years.  However, I saw that DeWalt has finally announced they are retiring the 18v XRP line.  My wife bought a 20v MAX leaf blower that came with a 4ah battery and charger.  I'm weighing my options and am interested in what other DeWalt users think.\n\n1. Buy some new 18v XRP batteries and revisit this decision in 5 years.  18v XRP batteries are $110 each.  This would be simple and 'cheap'.\n2. Buy some new 20v MAX batteries and an adapter to make them work in my XRP tools.  A kit with one adapter and 2 each 2ah 20v MAX batteries is $150.  I would probably need 2 of these kits because I like to be able to use multiple tools during a project without swapping the batteries and the kit only comes with one adapter.  I've also read some negative reviews online stating these adapters run hot and drain batteries.  What do y'all think of the adapter?  Are the 2ah batteries as good as the XRP ones?\n3. Buy some new 20v MAX tools and batteries.  I would need a 3/8 inch drill and a 6.5 inch circular saw at a minimum to start.  I would like to get a 1/2 inch impact and a 3/8 inch hammer drill.  I'm thinking that there could be some decent Black Friday deals I could take advantage of.  I've also read that there may a trade in program somewhere, but I can't find any specific details.  What kind of Black Friday deals have you seen?  Does anyone know of a trade in program and could send me the details?\n4. Abandon DeWalt and start buying a different brand.

Para-chains, para-threads, side-chains, etc. Without reading into the project, it really is impossible to know what the project is trying to achieve. I saw DOT first mentioned in a Forbes Article, which may have been concerning because it might mean it is more geared toward institutions and the banking industry- which generally rubs me the wrong way. I was confused when I kept reading people saying it was a block-chain that connected other block-chains, like Ethereum or VeChain (and others), you could write an application on Polkadot and utilize these other chains. \"That's really cool\", I thought- but also, \"Literally how is that supposed to work?\". On top of all of that, it is inflationary by design. I had a healthy amount of skepticism going into my initial research. \n\nOnce I decided to look into DOT, I watched a couple videos that gave a broad overview that gave me the 'why'. Polkadot is meant to be an abstracted layer for building apps generically that can utilize multiple block-chains using their development API that they call Substrate (best name in the project, kudos). The error I had from reading other posts about Polkadot was thinking that the previous examples (Ethereum, VeChain, etc) were literally being used beneath Polkadot, when in fact they aren't. That idea was just part of the analogy (though I'm not sure people posting that had this distinction).\n\nParachain's are created after buying an available slot at auction, and hooked into Polkadot via the Relay chain. The Relay chain is how each of the Para-chains and Para-threads communicate, and their state is reconciled onto the Relay chain. For Para-chains, this reconciliation occurs at every block, and for Para-threads it's only when needed. Basically, Para-thread blocks are in lock-step with the Relay chain. This is the main differentiation between Para-chains and Para-threads. Certain applications might require block-by-block validation by the Relay chain, while many other application use-cases do not. This results in lower transaction fees for the Para-threads.\n\nDr. Wood with the Ethereum background lends a lot of credence that the project is tackling real world issues and providing a solution that isn't available already. The documentation is great, and there actually **is** a whitepaper. I'm getting started with examples using Substrate surprisingly easy. Even if I  don't end up using Polkadot for a real-world application, it is still useful to me to know how much substance and utility the coin provide. After all, experience is everything.\n\nThe marketability and use-cases of a block-chain that provides the infrastructure to create versatile applications is clear. Providing an easy mechanism to create stand-alone block-chains without having to create and handle the infrastructure to do so is a major advancement, and will help many projects and companies get a huge jump in productivity. Not only that, but having the 'heavy-weight' option of Para-chains combined with the lighter-weight Para-threads, as well as pure smart-contracts (if you don't want contracts on top of the former two, and just need to run some custom logic on the Relay chain) give developers a lot of flexibility.   \n\n\nFundamentally, the use of Web Assembly standards show that they want it easy to use for wide-spread adoption. The use of Rust throughout much of the project shows that they are using current and forward-thinking technologies and are, most importantly, conscientious of security. Rust is well-known and gaining a lot of popularity due to its memory safety, which helps reduce potential bugs and attack vectors. Rust provides a current and stable language for the platform that developers actually use, instead of ones that are really only in use by researchers.\n\nAll-in-all, Polkadot seems to be a very sound investment with a bright future. Of the newer coins, Polkadot and Algorand are my top two picks. I'm Lionish on both, and I think that if the bull cycle continues through the end of the year there is no way Polkadot won't exceed its current all-time-high (\\~$55 USD).

This is broken up into 3 sections, so bear with me. \n\n\n\n# **What is Polkadot:**\n\n\n> Polkadot is a network protocol that allows arbitrary data, not just tokens, to be transferred across blockchains. \nThis means Polkadot is a true multi-chain application environment where things like cross-chain registries and cross-chain computation are possible.\nPolkadot can transfer this data across public, open, permissionless blockchains as well as private, permissioned blockchains.\nThis makes it possible to build applications that get permissioned data from a private blockchain and use it on a public blockchain. For instance, a school's private, permissioned academic records chain could send a proof to a degree-verification smart contract on a public chain.\n\n\nPolkadot was founded by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation) ,a Swiss Foundation. Its founders are [Dr. Gavin Wood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood) ,Robert Habermeier and Peter Czaban.\n\n\nCirculating Supply-987M\n\n\nTotal Supply-1.1B\n\n\nNo Max Supply\n\n\nIssue Date-August 2020\n\n\nProof-Of-Stake \ud83e\udd69\n\n\n\n\n# **What are Parachain Auctions:**\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get certain nomenclature established. The example following will be from Kusamas parachain auction. \n\n\n-As you know, blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset. This data is unable to be modified. \n\n\n-Parachains are individual layer-1 blockchains that run in parallel on Polkadot, connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain and secured by its validator set. Any type of data or assets can be sent between Parachains. Parachains connect to the Relay Chain by leasing a parachain slot via auctions, by being granted a slot by Polkadot governance as a common good chain (Parachain slots reserved for functionality that benefits the ecosystem as a whole. Such as Statemint) [Statemint](https://github.com/paritytech/statemint) or by connecting as a parathread (An idea for parachains to temporarily participate in Polkadot security without needing to lease a dedicated parachain slot by economically sharing the resource of a parachain slot.) \nParachains can also connect to external networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum using cross-network bridges. \n\n\n> Candle auctions are a variant of open auctions where bidders submit bids that are increasingly higher and the highest bidder at the conclusion of the auction is considered the winner.\nWhen candle auctions are used online, they require a random number to decide the moment of termination.\nParachain slot auctions differ slightly from a normal candle auction in that it does not use the random number to decide the duration of its opening phase. Instead, it has a known open phase and will be retroactively determined (at the normal close) to have ended at some point in the past during the ending phase. So during the open phase, bids will continue to be accepted, but later bids have higher probability of losing since the retroactively determined close moment may be found to have preceded the time that a bid was submitted.\n\n\n-BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension) is the block production mechanism that runs between the validator nodes and determines the authors of new blocks. BABE assigns block production slots to validators according to stake and using the Polkadot randomness cycle. \nValidators in Polkadot will participate in a lottery in every slot that will tell them whether or not they are the block producer candidate for that slot. Because of this randomness mechanism, multiple validators could be candidates for the same slot. Other times, a slot could be empty, resulting in inconsistent block time.\n\n\n-To become a parachain on Polkadot a project has to win a Slot Auction, with the max duration they can lease on it being 2 years. A full slot is divided into 8 lease periods making the minimum that a project can lease 3 months. \nA parachain slot is a scarce resource on Polkadot and only a limited number will be available. The goal is to eventually have 100 parachain slots available on Polkadot, split between parachains and the parathread pool.\nThe parachain slots will be sold according to an unpermissioned Candle Auction. \n\n\n**The Auction:**\nKusama and Polkadot use Candle Auctions for open blockchain implementation. Once the auction starts, project teams will place their bids. At a block number the candle auction starts and continues for a fixed duration. The projects can keep updating their bids with the auction winning block randomly picked from the candle auction phase. Whichever team has the highest bid is declared the winner. \n\n\n\u201cThe following example will showcase the randomness mechanics of the candle auction for the ninth auction on Kusama. Keep in mind that the candle phase has a uniform termination profile and has an equal probability of ending at any given block, and the termination block cannot be predicted before or during the auction.\u201d\n\n\n> Auction 9 starts at `block 9362014.` \nThe auction has a full duration equal to block `9362014` + `72000`. Here, `block 72000` is the \"ending period\", which is divided into **3600 samples of 20 blocks.** Figuratively, the candle is lit, and the candle phase lasts for 72,000 blocks. \n\n\n> The winning sample during the ending period turned out to have the index `1078.` \nSample 1078 refers to the winner as of `block 9362014` + `21560`, which equals `block 9383574.` \n\n\n> The parent block was a new BABE session in the 'Logs', which updated the randomness that was used to select that sample index. \nYou'd be able to inspect the state at the end of `block 9434277` and see the sample indices with an archive node. The digest in the 'Logs' of `9434277` is decodable and contains the random value as well as the BABE authorities. \n\n\u201cAs a result, the winner of this auction did not turn out to be the highest bid during the full duration.\u201d\n\n\n\n# **What you can do:**\n\n\nCrowdloan-A mechanism for potential parachains to temporarily source tokens to win an auction for a parachain slot. Tokens gathered in this way are programmatically returned to the lender after the lease period is over or the crowdloan period ends.\n\n\nUsing Kusama as an example, most parachains ran a crowdloan before the auctions began and would likely do the same on Polkadot.

And for those that actually participated, it have heard that it was very user-friendly to contribute via polkadot.js, through the exchanges, or via the bidder's websites. \n\nFor more info on what these auctions are and how to participate, this is a [good explanation](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/parachain-auctions). \n\nIf you are interested, Auction #2 is now currently underway (although, the clear favorite is Moonbeam).\n\nOne final note of important significance for those concerned with the price of DOT... these auctions (among all participants) have already locked up **87 million DOT.** That represents 7.75% of the ***total circulating supply*** (stats [here](https://polkadot.polkastats.io/) and [here](https://parachains.info/auctions/polkadot)). Again--grabbing my bullhorn--***this is the FIRST auction!*** Here is the upcoming auction schedule: \n\nAuction 2: Nov. 18, 2021 - Nov. 25, 2021\n\nAuction 3: Nov. 25, 2021 - Dec. 2, 2021\n\nAuction 4: Dec. 2, 2021 - Dec. 9, 2021\n\nAuction 5: Dec. 9, 2021 - Dec. 16, 2021\n\nAuction 6: Dec. 23, 2021 - Dec. 30, 2021\n\nAuction 7: Jan. 6, 2022 - Jan. 13, 2022\n\nAuction 8: Jan. 20, 2022 - Jan. 27, 2022\n\nAuction 9: Feb. 3, 2022 - Feb. 10, 2022\n\nAuction 10: Feb. 17, 2022 - Feb. 24, 2022\n\nYou may say, \"Well, Mark, you can't have 7% for every auction!\" ... I would say, that's true, but these results (1) confirm strong interest in the community in this \"venture capitalist\" function of Polkadot, (2) it clearly shows long-term commitment from the community as their DOT for now locked for 2 years(!), and (3) the second set of auctions in Kusama actually raised *more* than auctions 1-5.

Here Are The Top Projects with $2.5 Billion in DOT locked.*Disclaimer: I am invested into the parachain auctions for all the projects mentioned in this post*\n\nThe Polkadot network is comprised of a core relay chain to which several parachains connect. Each parachain acts a separate blockchain but comes with built-in interoperability with all other parachains on Polkadot. Parachain slots are limited, so competition is fierce over which projects will be able to secure them through the parachain auctions. \n\nThe parachain auctions are a key steps towards Polkadot achieving its mission to become a scalable multi-chain network. This feature explores parachain auctions and some of the most prominent projects that could be joining the network The most notable to date are Acala, Moonbeam, and Phala. \n\n## Acala \n\nAcala is aiming to become the go-to DeFi protocol for Polkadot. It\u2019s scalable, optimized for DeFi and offers EVM compatibility. Acala\u2019s key products include an automated market maker, a decentralized stablecoin, liquid DOT staking, and Ethereum interoperability. \nAcala was founded in 2019, and has many prominent backers including Coinbase Ventures and Pantera. One of its founders, Fuyao Jiang, built the Polkadot-focused mobile wallet Polkawallet. Moreover, it has received several grants from Gavin Wood\u2019s Web3 Foundation. Acala\u2019s sister network, Karura, won the first slot auction on Kusama after raising over 500,000 KSM tokens. Karura currently has roughly $280 million in total value locked. Acala will reward DOT contributors with ACA tokens, though full details on the distribution are still to be confirmed. \n\n## Moonbeam \n\nMoonbeam is a decentralized smart contract platform that seeks to help integrate Polkadot parchains and connect them to other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It bills itself as \u201cthe easiest path to multi-chain.\u201d Moonbeam\u2019s sister chain, Moonriver, won the second Kusama auction after raising 205,000 KSM. Dozens of existing projects are already building on Moonbeam, including Chainlink and SushiSwap.\n\nMoonbeam\u2019s native token is GLMR. 10% of the genesis GLMR supply is due to be allocated to crowdloan contributors, though registration to the crowdloan is limited to those in certain regions. \n\n## Phala\n\nPhala is a decentralized, privacy-preserving database that has smart contract functionality. Founded in 2018, it\u2019s one of the earliest projects hoping to launch on Polkadot. Given the public, transparent nature of information on blockchains, Phala allows for confidential or sensitive data to be handled by the blockchain. As technologies like ring signature and zk-SNARKS focus on providing privacy for cryptocurrencies rather than smart contracts, Phala offers a unique use case, dubbing itself as the \u201cGlobal Confidential Compute Cloud.\u201d \nPhala\u2019s PHA token is already tradable on open markets as an ERC-20 token. Like Acala and Moonbeam, Phala has a large community, which may be a sign that it will have significant crowdloan support in the upcoming parachain auctions. Phala has also received grants from the Web3 foundation. \n\nIf the these auctions go anything like the ones that happened on Kusama a few months ago, investors could be seeing massive profits and DOT could go parabolic.

Rewards calculations are being shown.\n   * If a crowdloan transaction is signed this options is also trustless and no 3rd party will ever hold your dot\n   * Some teams offer additional options to contribute here to offer liquid.\n   * These options can circumvent the minimum of 5 required dot to contribute (e.g. you can contribute only 1 dot)\n   * Extra bonuses like NFTs are possible\n* Cons:\n   * Higher chance for impersonating websites\n   * A new user might not know if the transaction he is signing is actually for the crowdloan\n   * Requires Polkadot.js Extension\n   * By using additional options that grand liquidity you will send your tokens to the crowdloan team and trust them to contribute and return it after 96 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Option 3: Use centralized exchanges\n\n* (E.g. Binance, Kraken, etc)\n* Pros:\n   * Convenient participation\n   * There might be bonus offers from the exchange\n* Cons:\n   * You trust your coins to a 3rd party and **dont hold your keys**\n   * 96 weeks is a long time and a lot can happen to exchanges in that timeframe\n   * Exchanges might take a cut from your distribution\n   * No NFT distribution\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Option 4: Use a mobile/web app/wallet\n\n* (E.g. Polkawallet, Talisman, Nova, Math Wallet, Fearless Wallet)\n* Pros:\n   * User friendly interface\n   * Smart phone comfort\n   * Might support NFTs and additional options to distribute (liquid options)\n* Cons:\n   * Some people might not be comfortable with a 3rd party app (even if it is open soruce)\n   * Might not support all options you would get on the official crowdloan pages\n   * Fear of accidently using a phising wallet\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And thats it.**\n\nThose are the 4 options you can use to participate in the crowdloan.\n\n**And now to which one I used.**\n\nI personally used the option to contribute via the **teams official websites**.\n\nI did so by **not giving away my keys** even though that means I am unable to use the liquid offers.\n\nFor me it is the best middle ground for user experience, bonuses and of course you can still hold your own keys.\n\nPolkadot.js might be a bit confusing at the start but I am actually starting to like it.\n\nI personally do **not** recommend using an exchange because even with good intentions they are a big target for hackers.

Everything fine so far, I did not worry, because I'm advanced crypto hodler (let's see how it goes).\n\nThere is a project I wanted to support and looking at some guides, it tells me to transfer my DOTs into \"Polkadot.{js}\" (DOTs hotwallet, the ETH counterpart of MetaMask).\n\nSo I did transfer my 6 DOT to Polkadot.{js}: **4.98 DOT received**\n\n\"What the heck?\", I thought. 1 DOT needs to be kept on a wallet to keep it active. \n\n\"Ok, fine.\", I reassured myself this is ok, went back to my exchange to get half a DOT to fill it up. I paid exchange withdrawal fee + paid transaction fee, but at least my Polkadot.{js} hot walllet has its 5 DOT.\n\n\"Ready to rumble\", I was eager to start supporting my project and started to crowdloan:\n\nWhile clicking and confirming some popups, it finally went to the page where I have to write in the amount I want to contribute: ** 5 DOT **\n\n**A Error message appears** At least 1 DOT is needed on a wallet!

Parachains are layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, etc. Why would a chain want to be a parachain on Polkadot? So it can inherit the security and decentralization from Polkadot. Being a parachain also allows it to communicate with Polkadot and all other parachain trustlessly - the interoperability part. \n\nBut becoming a parachain is not easy or free since many chains want it and the number of parachains Polkadot can support is limited for now. Hence to become one, a chain will have to win a parachain auction on Polkadot and to do that they will have to lock a certain amount of DOT to the auction. The one with the highest amount of DOT locked wins the auction.\n\nOkay, sounds complicated but why should you care? You should care because there's money to be made ofc. To win an auction projects will need a huge amount of DOT and they will borrow it from people. People like you and me can lend our DOT to a project. If that project wins we will get their token as a reward for lending them DOT and we also get our DOT back after 2 years. So it's basically   \n like you stake your DOT for 2 years to get some other token as rewards.\n\nSo how profitable it is to join an auction? I don't know but looking at Kusama parachain auctions I can say we can make a good amount of money. Let's take a look at Moon River parachain auction on Kusama for example. If you stake 1 KSM for that auction you would get 14.5 MOVR as reward which is at least 12x return in 2 about 2 months and you also get back your 1 KSM at the end.\n\nSo that's your alpha.

Large-scale payment providers like Visa and Mastercard and digital payment platforms like Paypal have started adding crypto support. However, these massive integrations did not take place in a vacuum and were the result of broader market sentiments.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Paypal's senior vice president and general manager of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez, commented that Paypal's decision to offer crypto services was a combination of factors such as the massive demand from consumers and merchants to use Crypto as a payment instrument along with regulatory clarity on the legality of the industry. He added,\n\n*\"We thought it was part of our responsibility to help make this asset class more accessible to the public.\"*\n\nPaypal first introduced the option to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies on the platform in October of last year. In its third quarter earnings report, the payments provider also revealed plans to increase its crypto offerings in the near future.\n\nHowever, the executive vehemently denied rumors about the launch of his own stablecoin. He said the sector had not yet evolved to support the large volume and small value of its transactions.\n\nMost of the stablecoins on the market are currently used for trading or for DeFi, according to Fernandez. Admitting that while these are good use cases, he said Paypal is more interested in payments, and \"we have not seen a stablecoin that is specifically designed for payments.\"\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost, as the platform is actively monitoring new L1 and L2 platforms that focus on large-scale payments, such as [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) , Lunars , Solana , and Algorand, he revealed, adding,\n\n*\u201cI'm sure if you ask me in six weeks I can give you four or five different names. That's how exciting it is \u201c*\n\nIn addition to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, another sector of the industry in which Paypal has shown interest is [NFT developmen](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)t, which have seen remarkable growth this year. Noting that he sees \"a role for us in the NFTs,\" for which he had high hopes, Fern\u00e1ndez added that several problems still interfere with such integration. He said,\n\n*\u201cThe experience of buying an NFT today is the number of rings it has to go through\u2026 That also affects the protection side.

The project has been referred to as a \u201cplatform of platforms\u201d by its developers. Uniquely, the protocol leverages three distinct blockchains to create an interoperable and trustless framework for developers to build upon. Additionally, Avalanche offers payment solutions in the form of a cryptocurrency (AVAX).\n\nWhat Problems Does Avalanche (AVAX) Solve?\n\nAvalanche was\u00a0built\u00a0to solve multiple issues found in most blockchain networks today. The platform combats centralization by providing a viable alternative to networks like Ethereum. It also builds upon some of the shortcomings of that network with more programmability, features, and functionalities.\n\nCongestion\n\nAvalanche is designed to be scalable. The network has demonstrated sub-second transaction times, putting it on par with the top payment processors in the world, such as VISA and PayPal. Specifically, the blockchain has can process 6,500 transactions per second. These transactions feature sub-second finality as well.\u00a0\n\nLow Fees\n\nIn terms of operating costs, the Gas fees on Avalanche are much more affordable than Ethereum. There are fees for creating and minting assets. You also pay fees on transactions, staking, and the creation of blockchains. These fees are then burned.\nAvalanche (AVAX) Features\n\nBenefits of Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche introduces some impressive benefits for corporate and individual users. The network allows businesses to effortlessly create new blockchains. Developers can construct a selection of blockchain services, tokens, and coins. Avalanche tokens can represent financial instruments such as equities, bonds, debt, fractionalized real estate, and more. They can also be coded as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nProgrammable\n\nOne of the core desires of the developers behind Avalanche was to allow businesses to create application-specific blockchains and\u00a0Dapps. The network was built to execute multiple custom virtual machines in addition to instances of the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM). Avalanche (AVAX) is flexible in that you can program using multiple languages, including EVM and WASM. The network was coded using the popular Go language.\nNetwork participants can easily create and trade digital smart assets. These newly formed tokens can be tailor-made to suit the developer\u2019s technical and regulatory requirements. In this way, Avalanche is ideal for the creation of defi platforms\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) Compliant Dapps\n\nAvalanches network allows\u00a0Dapp\u00a0developers to code in complex custom rule sets. This move was wise as it allows these developers to create regulatory compliant assets. The coding can be set to describe how the asset is handled and traded. This approach makes it easy to ensure compliance can be met.\n\nDeflationary\n\nAvalanche is a deflationary blockchain. The network collects fees from various actions and then sends these coins to be burned. The burning of these tokens reduces the total amount of AVAX in circulation. In turn, the demand for these tokens can be controlled and prices stabilized in the future.\u00a0\n\nHow Does Avalanche (AVAX) Work\n\nAvalanche introduces a triple-blockchain strategy to simplify conversions and development processes. The network also shares several features found in early blockchains like Bitcoin. Specifically, the UTXO model is the same. Also, the network reduces congestion further via a Segwit like protocol.\n\nSubnet\n\nOne of the core components of Avalanche is the ability to build blockchains. These new blockchains are known as Subnets within the Avalanche ecosystem. Developers have full programmability over these blockchains. They can set up the networks with unique tokens, rules, and fee structures. Notably, anyone can create their own subnet by paying a subscription fee in AVAX.\n\nX-chain\n\nThe first blockchain is known as the X-chain. X-chain is decentralized and designed to be easy to program. This network enables anyone to create and mint other smart digital assets. These new assets can be stablecoins, utility tokens, NFT\u2019s, wrapped tokens, equity, and more.\n\nC-Chain\n\nThe C-Chain was created to simplify the conversion for Ethereum Dapp developers. As a conversion chain, C-Chain is\u00a0compatible with all vital Ethereum tooling. Users can migrate their Dapps to this blockchain seamlessly. The network supports popular Ethereum features such as MetaMask, Web3.js, Remix, Truffle Suite, and the Embark Platform.\n\nP-Chain\n\nThe P-Chain is responsible for the utilities of the network. This chain is what\u2019s used to coordinate Validators. The blockchain also plays a role in monitoring and the creation of new subnets. P-chain allows for the staking of tokens on the network.\n\nAVAX Staking\n\nUsers can earn rewards in AVAX by staking on the network. Unlike its competitors, the hardware requirements are minimal for staking on Avalanche. You will need at least a dual-core processor, 4 GB Memory, and 40 GB SSD to run a Validator. On average, stakers receive rewards ranging between 9.69% and 11.54%.\u00a0\nYou must hold at least 2000 AVAX to qualify as a Validator on the network. Validators can validate multiple subnets but it\u2019s also mandatory to validate the primary network. Additionally, regular users can delegate their tokens to a Validator and receive rewards for their participation.\n\nConsensus\n\nAvalanche operates as a DPoS (Delegated-Proof-of-Work) ecosystem. Validators secure the network and approve transactions. DPoS networks are much faster than PoS or PoW options due to their reduced consensus requirements. Avalanche\u2019s blockchain is set up to accommodate millions of Validators all participating in consensus. This strategy provides layers of decentralization.\n\nAVAX\n\nAVAX is the main cryptocurrency of the Avalanche ecosystem. Users receive rewards and pay fees using this toke. In total, there are only 720 million AVAX tokens scheduled for issuance. Of these, 360 Million tokens were minted at launch. According to the platform\u2019s Tokenomics, the other 360 million are earmarked as staking rewards.\n\ufffc\n\nHistory of Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche had been in the works for over a year before it launched its mainnet in September 2020. The project was created by Ava Labs. Notably, this firm is led by Cornell researcher, Emin G\u00fcn Sirer.\u00a0\nAvalanche started running out of the gate. The platform\u2019s public token sale raised $42 million in 4.5 hours. Impressively, there were some notable participants include the venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz and participants from an\u00a0Ethereum Genesis address.\n\nHow to Buy Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nYou can find Avalanche (AVAX) on a number of top exchanges. Both\u00a0Binance\u00a0and\u00a0Huobi\u00a0support this.\n\nHow to Store Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nIf you seek to make a major investment in AVAX or if you are planning on HODLing this crypto for long periods of time, a\u00a0hardware wallet\u00a0is the best option. Hardware wallets keep your crypto stored offline in \u201ccold storage.\u201d This strategy makes it impossible for online threats to access your holdings. The\u00a0Ledger Nano S\u00a0or the more advanced\u00a0Ledger Nano X\u00a0both support Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) \u2013 Enterprise Blockchain 2.0\n\nAvalanche provides a unique feature set that makes it ideal for enterprise-level blockchain creation. The inclusive nature of the blockchain, coupled with its technical aspects, makes it stand out in the sector. You can expect to see more interest in this project as Ethereum developers continue to seek out more cost-effective alternatives.\n\n\nSource: David Hamilton", {"entities": [[3426, 3433, "crypto"], [20, 28, "crypto"], [42, 51, "crypto"], [409, 418, "crypto"], [504, 513, "crypto"], [529, 538, "crypto"], [844, 853, "crypto"], [1219, 1228, "crypto"], [1422, 1431, "crypto"], [1461, 1470, "crypto"], [1479, 1488, "crypto"], [1711, 1720, "crypto"], [1951, 1960, "crypto"], [2137, 2146, "crypto"], [2170, 2179, "crypto"], [2518, 2527, "crypto"], [2573, 2582, "crypto"], [2607, 2616, "crypto"], [2921, 2930, "crypto"], [3229, 3238, "crypto"], [3252, 3261, "crypto"], [3589, 3598, "crypto"], [3690, 3699, "crypto"], [4977, 4986, "crypto"], [5451, 5460, "crypto"], [5672, 5681, "crypto"], [5872, 5881, "crypto"], [6180, 6189, "crypto"], [6198, 6207, "crypto"], [6399, 6408, "crypto"], [6668, 6677, "crypto"], [6699, 6708, "crypto"], [6797, 6806, "crypto"], [7184, 7193, "crypto"], [7203, 7212, "crypto"], [7249, 7258, "crypto"], [53, 57, "crypto"], [477, 481, "crypto"], [515, 519, "crypto"], [1433, 1437, "crypto"], [1472, 1476, "crypto"], [2181, 2185, "crypto"], [2584, 2588, "crypto"], [3105, 3109, "crypto"], [3240, 3244, "crypto"], [3924, 3928, "crypto"], [4828, 4832, "crypto"], [4868, 4872, "crypto"], [5180, 5184, "crypto"], [5827, 5831, "crypto"], [5833, 5837, "crypto"], [5982, 5986, "crypto"], [6191, 6195, "crypto"], [6679, 6683, "crypto"], [6710, 6714, "crypto"], [6808, 6812, "crypto"], [6857, 6861, "crypto"], [7195, 7199, "crypto"], [7214, 7218, "crypto"]]}], ["Polkadot Breaks New Highs, Kusama Surges on Parachain Developments", {"entities": [[0, 8, "crypto"]]}], ["Friendly reminder: referral links are not allowed on r/PolkadotHi everyone,\n\nBy posting or commenting on this subreddit, you accept its [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/nfdch0/what_is_polkadot/).\n\nPlease remember that price, sale, **referral links**, investor-like and market discussions are not allowed.\n\nAll posts and comments with referral links will be removed.

The first round is officially debuting on November 11th. I'd say the *active* aspect of these auctions is what's got me hooked, because it feels to me like I'm not just holding a particular coin/token waiting for its value to rise (not that there's anything wrong with that!).\n\nI've been reading left and right about the overall participation process as a simple plebian, and I've subscribed to a couple newsletter (which I never do) to make sure I stay in the know for the upcoming weeks. One thing I've learned is that **you can already participate in the first round right now**, as an *early bird* participant and obtain greater rewards for doing so.\n\nThing is, **my DOT is currently unbonding** and should be available somewhere on November 10th, which gives me **less than a single day** to spread my DOT across my favorite projects crowdloans and get that sweet bonus.\n\nAnd so this brings me to this post, which will act as my personal notes to ensure I am ready to participate on the 10th. Also wanted to share everything that I'd record too, in case it could benefit anyone else on this sub. You peeps deserve it.\n\n# How I heard about the auctions\n\n**First up is Coin Bureau's** [**Polkadot Projects That Are HOT!

Even though the video is kinda old (March), make sure to at least watch the initial explanation of the Polkadot ecosystem which goes up to about 6:45 for a great introduction to the ecosystem. There's also the *Common Good Parachains* part at the end (17:40) that you should take a look at.\n\nI'm not trying to shill the projects presented in this video either, but they are names you'll encounter sooner than later if you're reading up on the auctions. Might as well learn what they are if you're hungry for knowledge.

Someone on this sub suggested the platform, but I did not take a moment to check it out at that time.\n\nYou can learn more about Litentry's crowdloan event here: [Litentry Crowdloan Event \u2013 The Web3 Identity Hub on Polkadot](https://crowdloan.litentry.com/).\n\n**Third is James Agenda's** [**holdpolkadot.com**](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/) **blog**\n\nNow I'm not usually a fan of blogs, but with the situation at hand I just want to have quick access to information regardless of its origin (as long as it is legit).

But then I heard and read about [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi/). Looked simple and clean, so I tried to emulate my participation to a project and see how it goes. Here's what I did.\n\n**Set up the Polkadot{.js} browser extension**\n\n1. Installed and enabled the [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) on my browser (if you're a fellow Brave user, simply install the Chrome version)\n2. Added my wallet to the extension (you can create one if you don't have any).\n3. Made sure I have DOT available for transfer in your wallet. By that I mean you see a **transferrable** DOT balance in your wallet account on [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) (*locked, bonded* or ***unbonding*** will not do \\*cries\\*)\n\nIf you need more information regarding these 3 steps, refer to [this blog post](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/how-to-prepare-polkadot-js-for-crowdloans-in-parachain-auctions-step-by-step-tutorial).\n\n**Connected my wallet to the Parallel Finance App**\n\n1. Visited the [Parallel Finance Polkadot Crowdloan App](https://crowdloan.parallel.fi/#/auction/polkadot)\n2. Connected my wallet using the *Connect to Wallet* button up top\n3. This prompted me to authorize the site to the Polkadot{.js} extension\n4. Clicked *Yes, allow this application access*\n\nNow I was able to contribute to the crowdloan for the projects listed on Parallel Finance (even though I have no available balance at the moment). Here is the current list (at time of writing) if you want to save a click, or learn more about individual projects:\n\n* [Acala](https://acala.network/)\n* [Astar](https://astar.network/)\n* [Litentry](https://www.litentry.com/)\n* [Manta](https://manta.network/)\n* [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/)\n* [Parallel](https://parallel.fi/)\n* [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/)\n* [Darwinia Network](https://darwinia.network/)\n* [Equilibrium](https://equilibrium.io/en)\n* [Clover](https://clover.finance/)\n\n# Conclusion and future edits\n\nHope I didn't break any rules with the amount of links I put in there.

If you\u2019re the kind of guy that buys real tokens and not just meme coins, this is the project for you! The standard for pay-back tokens so far is flawed, with pay-back in the same token, taxes for all affect the price the same, redistributed taxes re-enter the market and cause drops. Which is why reflective tokens have become so popular in the past months. Taxes are applied in every transaction, which in turn purchase and drop a separate high value token to all holders with affecting the value of the original, giving passive income in stable high-marketap projects. For this reason and many other, InfinityDOT is a promising token, at the height of the bullrun, in a moment in which all chains are filled by meme-coins with no porpose that die within days, we have new token that provides actual value, and like it\u2019s precedesor reflective tokens, it\u2019s here to stay. As opposed to coins such as EverETH, or InfinityADA, InfinityDOT provides it\u2019s reflection in Polkadot, a self-named etherum killer that has grown into a top 10 Marketcap coin with extremely dedicated development, community and an indisputable bright future ahead. Here comes InfinityDOT, while new tokens on Polkadot are still few in comparasion to the giants that are the Binance Smart Chain and Etherum, work for it\u2019s future can start off-chain, with reflective tokens. InfinityDOT not only proposes as an investment opportunity it\u2019s possible growth, but also the certain growth of a stable future token with a long history on the market. A future of the InfinityDOT token on it\u2019s father chain that is BSC and a promising future on the parachain of Polkadot! The token has much work to do, the concept is promising, yet simple for anyone to understand, and compared to the majority of BSC Tokens, has a high survival chance. The team has just started going public, with a possible pre-sale to raise liquidity this week, a sale on DxSale to raise trust trough locked liquidity, a public open source contract to prove it\u2019s security, and a perfect moment for a real project to start, in a sea of short-lived meme tokens, a real project is a real needle in a haystack.

This is because for each buy/sell, the community is rewarded 10% of dot and the liquidity increases due to 2% from the buy/sell\n\n4) long red candle is not whales dumping, it's rather a reward zone so do not freak out and sell your portfolio else you miss this millionaire making epic journey\n\n5)10% polkadot reward is send by the contract every 1hr but only those whose theirs is equal to the release threshold amount gets it for that hour. \n\nIf yours is not up to the threshold for example in the first hour, the contract saves it for you and keep adding the rewards until it is up to the threshold, then it releases it for you in the next release hour. \n\nSo do not start asking questions about why you  haven't gotten polkadot reward for an hour or 3 to 6hrs. The reward is shared based on the volume of everdot you have.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that you get the reward more often than waiting longer to build up, just load your bag up more with everdot\n\n6) Max supply is 1 trillion\n\nOut of this no burn will occur because the Devs believe that every token is important for the reward process and also for liquidity.\n\nHere fixed but frequently varying circulating supply is more important than deflationary\n\n7) Devs and admins are hardworking and most admins were normal community members who devoted to serve this great house.

It is a similar project, in several ways, to other stable coins. It is also the stable coin managed directly by the Coinbase and Coinbase PRO exchanges, one of the most important exchanges in the world. USD Coin, as it should be more than clear from the name, is pegged to the dollar. What does this mean? It means that the value of a USDC token will always be equal to the value of one dollar. We will always be able to convert (we will see the special cases later) a token of this type into dollars.  As we can then see on the main markets that change it, the price can fluctuate very slightly with respect to that of the dollar, generally in the order of thousandths of a percentage. These are very small variations that are mostly dependent on the small inefficiencies that can be created on the market. Perhaps one of the best qualities of USDC is that it is controlled by a consortium, in which partecipate several players in the cryptocurrency industry. It was in fact founded by Circle, and today also hosts the popular Coinbase exchange, and the mining company Bitmain, which is one of the largest investors in Circle. An internal project? No. A project that today has behind it the most serious groups circulating in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nLike all stable coins, USD Coin also has as its main use to act as a counter value on high-frequency exchanges, obviously being tokenized. Therefore, its first use is to act as a counterparty in the negotiations that take place within the main exchanges. Coinbase aims to use it as a means of payment, offering free wallets and above all the possibility for everyone to exchange a crypto with a stable value expressed in dollars without the delays and costs that are instead connected to classic banking. USD Coin is a ERC-20 token, which is a token that is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. A choice of this type has proved to be a winning one over time because the Ethereum network today offers reliability and allows this stable token, USDC, to be used in many decentralized finance projects. USDC is not mined, that means it is not created by solving very complicated algorithmic calculations. In fact this product is issued on demand. Anyone who buys USDC from Coinbase will have new ones delivered and never released. The doubt in this case is that Coinbase, as well as the other agents involved in the project, can issue more money than they will actually be able to convert one day. This problem can be overcome, provided that the exchange actually has US dollars or equivalent in cash.\n\n# Where to store it?\n\nThe best hot wallets for USD Coin are Coinbase Wallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.\n\n# Pros&Cons\n\n\\*DISCLAIMER\\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person\n\n**Pros**\n\n1.

As discussed in a prior post, the real deadline is later.  \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oqq9hs/quick\\_primer\\_on\\_the\\_debt\\_ceiling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/oqq9hs/quick_primer_on_the_debt_ceiling/)\n\nBack roughly a decade ago, there was a great deal of discussion in the media about a contingency option in the event that the United States Government would be unable to make payments as appropriated(1) with available funds.  \n\nThe contingency rested on a very aggressive interpretation of existing Statute.  Put simply, while the Statutes are clear that the Federal Government only gets paid cost plus a small markup for printing Federal Reserve Notes (ie, physical USD), the Federal Government, through the various program funds at Treasury, recognizes the full amount of Seigniorage from striking/minting a coin and selling it.  \n\nThe strategy that was being discussed was for Treasury to mint a special coin, hypothetically a Trillion USD (through individual Billion USD coins were more likely) to be sold to the Federal Reserve, who would credit the Treasury General Account (TGA) with the payment. In this situation, the argument was that the Federal Government then would have time to increase the Debt Ceiling, through some interpretations went so far as to argue the Fed would pay with Debt held by the Fed (this was fairly early in the QE process), allowing the Statutory process of Debt Issuance to continue.  \n\nOfficially, this idea was rejected by then-President Obama himself, and it's unclear how far the Administration debated the idea.  However, the staff level discussions between Treasury and the Fed have never been reveled, only the official minutes of the FOMC and BoG meetings reference the Treasury contingency plans(2) about prioritizing certain payments over others.  No operational guidance was released then or since.  \n\nPresent Day:\n\nIt is likely this discussion will return.  The arguments against the idea then are just as strong today, Congress has a Debt Ceiling, and the Federal Reserve, or more precisely the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is a creature of Statute.  To take such an act would roil the political and finance scene in ways that are difficult to predict. \n\nNoticeably, Congress still has not enacted any legislation to deal with such a contingency, despite numerous proposals introduced over the years.  \n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that the external contingency plan proposed by Warren Buffett would be used.  Mr. Buffett indicated he spoke with the heads of major Corporations, and all agreed that in the event Congress needed a few more days, they would all make their Corporate Income Tax payments ahead of schedule to fund the Federal Government.  It is unclear how much time this would buy the Federal Government in the event the TGA and Extraordinary Measures are exhausted, in the event it comes to that.  \n\n(1) I leave to others, and ultimately the Courts, the debates if Appropriations, Entitlement Statutes, or the Debt Limit are controlling on what constitutes a \"default\".  The public will most likely pick whichever option they individual feel the strongest about.    \n\n(2) Officially, there was not and is not any contingency plan. Unofficially, it was felt that having a plan would make it more likely the event would happen, and it would be torn apart in Court in any event.", {"entities": [[44, 52, "crypto"]]}], ["USD Coin Staking??This is probably an extremely dumb and uneducated post and I\u2019m ready to get some hate if it is haha!! \n\nAnyways, i see USD coin which i believe basically if i deposit and hold that and i guess stake it i will earn .15APY on my cash.\n\nMy question is can i get that cash back at anytime or is it being held for X amount of days??\nAlso how would i get my profits/watch my profits for USD coin if i can sell it.\n\nLastly: isn\u2019t this rate pretty high like even for a bank??

This means there is no reason why there is any less than 100% dependability on the USDC at all times.

This includes enticing the wider public to trade regulated products without any consumer protection (Mirror Protocol) and luring savers with high returns without explaining the risk of losing the principal (Anchor Protocol) when/if UST collapses.\n\n>2.

Stripper Dollars have a tendency to become worthless overnight. Algorithmic stablecoins have a similar track record.\n\n>Is UST really the best USD stablecoin for Osmosis? It seems like we could easily do better by adopting an existing USD backed stablecoin such as USDC.\n\n>When evaluating the commentary and voting on this proposal, keep in mind that key figures from in the Cosmos ecosystem are heavily invested in Luna and thus have strong economic incentive to see UST and Luna integrated in Osmosis, regardless of risk and long term consequences to the ecosystem.\n\n>Voting *YES* on this proposal signal that we, as the broader community,\n\n>1.

No so F them.\n\nDoes Bank of America do this? No so F them.\n\nDoes CitiBank do this? No so F them.\n\n2021 introduced me to crypto after having heard the word Bitcoin sporadically here and there the last 10 years and not looking into it properly (like an idiot). Find any way to distance yourself from the old banking system. F them. Let them go extinct. They don't give AF about you, me, your momma or your daddy. This wonderful crypto community is so amazing and I've learned so much from everyone.\n\nI tried uploading a screenshot of my Coinbase app showing the **4%** in rewards on r/CryptoCurrency but I guess the mods on that sub don't allow us to upload pictures in posts anymore. Oh well.\n\nI chose to go with **4%** XLM even though they also offer 1% Bitcoin because I want to accumulate as many as I can and I believe in XLM very, very much. Almost zero gas fees and very fast so that's a big plus in my mind.\n\nIs anyone else using the CB debit card? My plan is to pay my car insurance and cell phone bill with the CB debit card, groceries, miscellaneous stuff, and when family goes to the market I offer to use my card and they'll give me the cash so I can go to the bank afterwards to deposit more dirty, dirty fiat (yuck) to top off my debit card.\n\nTldr: F the banks. Use CB debit. Earn rewards. The future is now, old man!\n\nEdit: Uploaded screenshot of my Coinbase app showing XLM rewards data.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06b7glipidn71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f9538759d933529013392c34f80891c1579c97", {"entities": [[1056, 1063, "crypto"], [1655, 1662, "crypto"], [19, 23, "crypto"]]}], ["Voyager Digital Launches USDC-Linked Debit Card", {"entities": [[25, 29, "crypto"]]}], ["Crypto earn USDC interest questionDoes anyone calculate their expected interests vs actual to see if they match up?

In March 2021, [VISA became the first major payment network to settle transactions using USDC](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.17821.html). Groundbreaking, right? The mega financial servicing company ***VISA*** using an Ethereum-based stablecoin cryptocurrency to settle domestic and cross-border payments.\n\nYes, this is an extraordinarily optimistic development for the Ethereum ecosystem, but it is arguably even more optimistic for The Graph. [The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) is a decentralized indexing protocol that allows applications, users, and other entities to query different blockchain networks for data. The Graph recently processed **$1 billion daily queries** in June 2021 roughly 2 years since launch for reference, Google was processing just 200 million queries per day in 2004, which was 6 years after it launched). How does this work? For example, when someone opens the website [CoinGecko.com](https://CoinGecko.com) and wants to view data related to the price, volume, or market capitalization of a token, CoinGecko has to ask The Graph to provide CoinGecko with the most recent datapoints so that CoinGecko can present such data to the user. The Co-Founder and CEO of CoinGecko explains this in depth [here](https://twitter.com/tmlee/status/1285766039951699969?s=20https://twitter.com/tmlee/status/1285766039951699969?s=20).\n\nProviding CoinGecko with near-realtime blockchain data is just one of an infinite number of ways that The Graph provides blockchain data to the outside world. Why does this matter and why are we talking about The Graph when we started by talking about Ethereum, VISA, and USDC?\n\nWell, in order to build and develop applications using data from the Ethereum blockchain, the data needs to be indexed. In other words, for a developer to create an application on Ethereum, first they must organize the relevant blockchain data from Ethereum's network and make it easier to retrieve such data so it can be presented to the consumer in a faster manner. The way that The Graph provides this data to developers is by organizing relevant data into subgraphs, and [each major application and network have their own unique subgraphs on The Graph's network](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/) with their own unique relevant data.\n\nIf CoinGecko wanted to provide blockchain data to their customers without using The Graph, they would have to organize all of this data themselves and it could take years to do so and would waste a lot of developer resources. This is like opening a book to find a specific topic by reading every line (ie, CoinGecko doing it manually) versus going to the index at the back of the book to find the exact page with the information you are looking for (ie, CoinGecko using The Graph).\n\nWell, [USDC has their own subgraph](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/centrehq/usdc), and anyone who wants to develop applications that track data related to the use of USDC, and naturally, the use of USDC by VISA, can simply use The Graph's USDC subgraph. Eva Beylin, the Director of The Graph, articulates it very well [here](https://mobile.twitter.com/evabeylin/status/1376606531408388098):\n\n>If you want to track all USDC transactions on Visa, you can query the USDC subgraph.  Congrats Visa on choosing public & open source infrastructure. This is a revolutionary move for an industry predicated on closed-source technology.\n\nIt gets better. Messari, a cryptocurrency research and data tool, is hosting a major event called [Mainnet 2021](https://mainnet.events/) centered around The Graph's protocol on September 21-23 in New York City. Guests and speakers include representation from countless applications and networks that use The Graph, including Aave, 1inch, Coinbase, Kraken, OpenSea, Alchemy, Dapper Labs, Arbitrum, Algorand, Avalanche, Ethereum, Synthetix, Solana, and more.\n\nWhy am I mentioning this?\n\nWell, there is also another special attendee and speaker: [Catherine Gu](https://mainnet.events/speakers/catherine-gu/), the [Head of Global Central Bank Digital Currencies at VISA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wcgu). There have been hints by the founders of The Graph like [Yaniv Tal](https://twitter.com/yanivgraph/status/1429129704724787208?s=19) that this will be a very important meeting and that something big is going to happen at this meeting.\n\nRegardless of whether there is or is not some major announcement related to The Graph and VISA, we already know the facts: VISA's flagship stablecoin is USDC, which is an Ethereum token, and the entirety of USDC's data can be easily retrieved from the USDC subgraph on The Graph's network. Once VISA provides full-fledged support for USDC and it is the primary means of exchanging the US dollar using VISA cards, mobile device applications that provide a list of your history of payments made using VISA cards (eg, banking apps, Uber, food delivery apps, etc.) will need to make a choice: should they allocate significant developer time and resources to manually organizing all of the data relevant to USDC on Ethereum's blockchain so they can provide the data to their users? or should they simply retrieve that data from The Graph's USDC subgraph, where it is already organized and updated in near-realtime for them?\n\nMy bet is that every company, person, service, application, and bank in the world who needs to track the usage of USDC by VISA services will use The Graph's USDC subgraph.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: u/DomiekNSFW's wife is not going to be happy with me for this post [lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pad3hf/the_graph_and_ethereum_are_the_backbone_of_the/ha3w39m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEDIT 2: The tokenomics FUD is [baseless](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paeep5/visa_ethereum_and_the_graph_grt_ethereum_and_the/ha92yv9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", {"entities": [[4360, 4366, "crypto"], [145, 149, "crypto"], [188, 192, "crypto"], [495, 499, "crypto"], [2143, 2147, "crypto"], [3284, 3288, "crypto"], [3458, 3462, "crypto"], [3490, 3494, "crypto"], [3531, 3535, "crypto"], [3710, 3714, "crypto"], [3755, 3759, "crypto"], [5011, 5015, "crypto"], [5065, 5069, "crypto"], [5110, 5114, "crypto"], [5192, 5196, "crypto"], [5560, 5564, "crypto"], [5693, 5697, "crypto"], [5892, 5896, "crypto"], [5935, 5939, "crypto"], [4328, 4337, "crypto"]]}], ["I tried converting 556 USDC tokens into ETH today through bancor and charged me a $28 network fee 3 times yet never converted my tokens and there's no options for support - where can I get help?

AVAX Explained!What is Avalanche?\nAvalanche is a new blockchain network with sub-second transaction times and low fees. Created by Ava Labs, a company led by Cornell researcher Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, the project launched its mainnet in September 2020.\n\nAfter raising $18 million from prominent investment firms such as Andreesen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, the project raised another $42 million in under 4.5 hours with the public launch of its AVAX token in July 2020, with the stated goal of outclassing ETH2.0 in terms of throughput and latency.\n\nHow it Works?\nThe Avalanche network consists of multiple blockchains, and uses a novel proof of stake consensus mechanism to achieve high throughput, estimated to reach over 4500 transactions per second.\n\nAvalanche claims that its consensus protocol combines the benefits of \"Nakamoto consensus\" (robustness, scale, and decentralization) and \"Classical consensus\" (speed, quick finality, and energy efficiency) to form a revolutionary consensus engine.\n\nUnder the Avalanche model, each chain is a separate instance of a virtual machine, with support for multiple custom virtual machines such as EVM and WASM, allowing chains to have use case-specific functionality. Each of these virtual machines is deployed on a custom blockchain network called a subnet, which is comprised of \"a dynamic set of validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of blockchains\" - in other words, each subnet has its own set of incentive mechanisms to ensure validators stay honest.\n\nAvalanche can thus be described as a \"platform of platforms\", consisting of thousands of subnets to form a single interoperable network.\n\nThe Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge -\nThrough its accelerator, Avalanche-X, Ava Labs is \"investing heavily in grants to DeFi projects\". One of these grants went to ChainSafe to develop a cross-chain Ethereum bridge.\n\nThe Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge is \"a two-way token bridge that enables seamless ERC-20 and ERC-721 transfers between Avalanche and Ethereum.\" In order to use Ethereum-based assets with dapps on Avalanche, users can lock these assets in the ChainBridge contract and mint an equivalent token on the Avalanche network.\n\nThe Benefits\nAs DeFi becomes increasingly popular, users are being priced out of the ecosystem due to Ethereum's high network fees. With the price of ETH on the rise, even basic token swaps on Ethereum are becoming prohibitively expensive for entry-level players, while interactions with more complex DeFi contracts can come attached with fees exceeding 0.1 ETH .\nFurther, as gas prices on Ethereum are subject to sudden spikes, many of these transactions will fail, costing the user potentially hundreds of dollars worth of ETH without even executing the transaction.\nThe Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge represents a step towards migrating Ethereum's slow and costly DeFi infrastructure to the significantly faster and cheaper Avalanche network. Transaction fees on Avalanche are rarely more than a few cents, while even complicated computations cost in the single digit dollar range to execute, and are significantly faster - currently so rapid as to be near-instantaneous.\n\n\nImplications\nThe implications of the Avalanche network and the advent of the Avalanche-Ethereum Bridge are wide and far-reaching.\n\nAccessibility - The low cost of transactions on Avalanche means that smaller trades are more financially viable, opening up the DeFi ecosystem to smaller players and entry-level investors. While the user experience is still complex and represents a significant barrier to entry, improvements in this area could lead to a wider range of participants in the world of DeFi.\n\nLow slippage - The slow speed of the Ethereum blockchain often leads to significant slippage and failed transactions when conducting on-chain trades. The faster transaction rate and higher throughput of the Avalanche network opens the door to minimal price slippage and instant trades, bringing the experience of trading on DEXs closer to that of their centralized counterparts.\n\nETH2.0 - There has been understandable hype around the upcoming launch of ETH2.0 and the greater scalability it promises to bring, especially as transactions on Ethereum grow ever more costly. However, with networks like Avalanche growing in popularity in the meantime, the launch of ETH2.0 may end up being less impactful than anticipated.\n\nAvalanche and its underlying token AVAX is currently the 14th cryptocurrency by total market capitalization according to\u00a0CoinMarketCap.

different types of functionality, from smart contracts to the tokenization of financial assets external to this blockchain. It's system launched in 2020, which integrates all or almost all of the main features that we are used to seeing within decentralized finance infrastructures. But what are the usecases of this network?\n\n* **Creation of private blockchains**: the first of the interesting aspects of this project is the possibility, by companies or even by individuals, of creating blockchains within the project, with their own rules and with operating mechanisms decided according to the contract. A feature that, as we will see later, aims to transform Avalanche into a real hub for interfacing blockchain and the real economy. The blockchains created within the project can be set up in both public and private mode.\n* **Creation of digital assets**: that is, the tokenization of both intellectual property and financial assets instead. In the creation of these specific tokens, specific rules can be inserted, also offering compliance with the laws that each country imposes on the trading of financial assets. The ductility of this specific aspect of Avalanche is maximum and perhaps today unmatched in the market space of decentralized finance.\n* **Smart contracts and Dapps**: the Avalanche protocol allows developers to build their own contracts, with a platform that is at least infinitely scalable on paper and allows execution in less than a minute. In addition, the protocol can also be used to support the development of DApps, that is decentralized apps that use the resources made available both by this blockchain and by public or private blockchains.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nBehind the basic concepts for Avalanche AVAX there are important technologies and operating mechanisms that must be duly analyzed to understand what type of system we have in front of us and if it can actually establish itself on the market, also increasing the value of the AVAX token, which is the reference cryptocurrency and linked, in terms of value and functioning, to this protocol.\n\n* **Asset creation:** the Avalanche protocol allows you to create assets within its blockchain. It can integrate the ERC 20 format, which we are used to knowing on the Ethereum blockchain. However, it also includes the possibility of creating Fixed-Cap Assets, tokens that are interchangeable with a maximum number in circulation and also - this is a relative novelty within a network of this type - Variable Cap Assets, whose number maximum in circulation can be modulated over time.\n* **NFT**: the Avalanche network also allows the creation of NFT  (Non Fungible Tokens). The process for creating this type of token is clear and simple and allows everyone to create their own unique tokens, representative of a certain digital property.\n* **Create your own blockchain**: very interesting is the possibility offered by Avalanche AVAX to create subnets, or sub-blockchains, public or private, which rely on the resources and basic rules of the project, but which can be managed separately and with their own rules. For the moment these subnets are physically separate from the Avalanche network, but in the future, even if the timing is not yet clear, the integration will be total.\n* **Governance of the protocol**: it is an aspect that relates directly to the basic functioning of AVAX and that is related to part of its value. Also for this blockchain, like many that we have already seen in the space occupied by DeFi, it is necessary to stakare coin to have the power to vote on the future of the project.\n\nAvalanche runs on three different integrated blockchains. We have the blockchain where assets are created and exchanged, the one that allows subnets to be coordinated and the one that runs smart contracts. The system is perfectly integrated and allows the use of transversal solutions between these services.

I forget to charge my phone at night, so thought this was a great solution! I can immediately see what time it is when I wake up (because the anxiety of sleeping in and finding a clock is overwhelming) and my phone charges every night!\n\nThree weeks ago, I put my phone on it upside down.  Apparently the wireless contact acts funky with the screen - it triggers trying to open the phone.  Unbeknownst to me, when my phone screen is triggered too many times _wrongly_, it wipes itself. \n\nSo all my alarms for medicine, notes, reminders, specific sounds and ring tones for different things - all gone.  \n\nSo cue me frantically trying to download the fundamentals at work to just exist.  \n\nMessing with my medicine caused a mini downward spiral and I got a cold.  I'm a developer and suddenly I was making a whole bunch of small mistakes EVERYWHERE.  My brain was not on straight.  I forgot about filing weekly reports.  My sleep suffered because I've been working late to make up for lack of productivity.  \n\nI've now spent the last two weeks getting absolutely nothing done and my boss is trying to figure out why.  I feel like I finally surfaced from an ocean of ick, and now I have to swim to shore.  \n\nI also now have to remember how to do work again! Everything has just stalled and I have to build up momentum again.  \n\nFuck me for trying to improve, right? Proud of myself for weathering the last month though.  I just charge my phone in another room now, because the negative feelings associated with the new alarm clock won't go away.  \n\nBecause of daylight savings time, the clock is the wrong time anyway \ud83d\ude43", {"entities": [[9, 18, "crypto"]]}], ["Frost Avalanche", {"entities": [[6, 15, "crypto"]]}], ["[Stephen Whyno] A little Canadian Olympic roster nugget: Avalanche defenseman Samuel Girard says GM Doug Armstrong told him he is NOT on Canada's \"long list\" of players eligible to make the team.", {"entities": [[57, 66, "crypto"]]}], ["21Shares Launches Polygon, Avalanche And Algorand ETPs On Biggest Swiss Stock Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange", {"entities": [[27, 36, "crypto"]]}], ["PGT | Columbus @ Avalanche | Stolen PointAvs lose 5-4 in overtime.", {"entities": [[17, 26, "crypto"]]}], ["Avalanche claims to be an eventual better layer 0 solution than IOTA.

I was in a very strange place at this time. I was more famous than I\u2019d ever been due to the recent release of Ridin\u2019 Dirty. I was also in the first year of the relationship with my now-wife Queenie. So there was a lot of professional as well as personal stress on me. I couldn\u2019t find anything to relax me. Then one night, watching MTV, I saw the \u201cParanoid Android\u201d video. Suddenly, for some reason, this calm washed over me. It seemed like this song was speaking to me. I bought the album the next day and everything about it made sense. While very dense and layered at times, it was still very melodic and easy to listen to. And a lot of what they spoke about then still resonates to this day. So even now, when life starts moving too fast, OK Computer is still there to help slow it down for me.\n\n-\n\n>#Dave Portner/Avey Tare (Animal Collective)  \n**Quasimoto\u2019s The Unseen (2000)**\n\n>The summer of 2000 was a high point for AC. Creatively, we were at the start of what would become our most free and exploratory era and on the cusp of a journey that continues today. It seems almost serendipitous that The Unseen appeared just before the summer kicked into full gear and became our soundtrack. It was lo-fi, it was mysterious, it was part sound collage, part hook-ridden hip-hop, and part mushroom trip. (Rumors circulated that Madlib mixed the whole thing while tripping.)\n\n>We felt a kinship with the record-digger personality who could easily sample Alice Coltrane\u2019s free piano and place it beside the soundtrack to La Plan\u00e8te Sauvage, making it all groove while still being a bit unhinged. It was transportive and alien but also grounded and familiar in the traditions of jazz, rap, and psychedelic music that it adhered to. It gleamed in so many of the ways we wanted to present AC: mysterious characters from another world who would infect the current trends with our own personalities and something a bit different. Never wanting to be copycats, we just hoped we could make something as personal and special. We still do.\n\n-\n\n>#Lil B\n**Pastor Troy\u2019s We Ready I Declare War (1999)**\n\n>This album is a super-special, self-produced, all-around classic. I always come back to this tape and listen and hear something new! It\u2019s a very inspiring tape to me, and something I will always keep with me and around me. Really, you should listen to every song from front to end because it\u2019s a movie! I love the sound, the production, the rapping on it; it\u2019s just the most honest album I have heard and still stands relevant to this day. My favorite song on the album is \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine.\u201d\n\n-\n\n>#Thundercat\n**Slipknot\u2019s Slipknot (1999)**\n\n>I remember discovering this album with Cameron and Taylor Graves, Ronald, and Kamasi around the same time. We were teenagers, of course, and it sent us (more so Cam, Tay, and I) on a metal quest (lol) that actually led them (Cam and Tay) to play in the band Wicked Wisdom with Jada Pinkett Smith (lol). The cool thing about discovering this album\u2014and there never being anything like it before or after, and still to this day it stands alone\u2014[is that] when my daughter came of age, I hand-passed that album down to her (Sanaa, my daughter, who I have given a nickname \u201cDerp Cobain\u201d lol), and it\u2019s awesome to watch her ears and mind expand and grow from hearing the awesomeness that is Slipknot. Rest in Peace, Joey Jordison.\n\n-\n\n>#Timbaland\n**OutKast\u2019s SpeakerBoxxx/The Love Below (2003)**\n\n>OutKast\u2019s album Speaker Boxxx/The Love Below was always one of my favorite albums. They brought a whole new sonic to the game and changed the game with \u201cHey Ya!\u201d and \u201cThe Way You Move.\u201d It was just groundbreaking at that time.\n\n-\n\n>#Tony Di Blasi (The Avalanches)\n**J Dilla\u2019s Donuts (2006)**\n\n>J Dilla\u2019s cut-up sample masterpiece is a spiritual experience to listen to. There is something more to this than just music. A layer of otherworldliness. He accesses another dimension that we intuitively know resides in us all. The way the compression is used adds a kind of breathless feeling. It\u2019s haunting, surreal, experimental, and heartbreaking. Layer upon layer of hidden sample meaning unfolds the deeper you dive in and the longer you spend with this record.\n\n>Donuts feels like both darkness and light at the same time. Sitting at the point where joy and sorrow meet. Dilla transmuted his final time on earth into a work of art that will remain eternal.\n\n-\n\n>#Vince Staples\n**Lauryn Hill\u2019s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)**\n\n>This album has been a constant throughout my life. It\u2019s really unique. Nowadays we get a combination of singing and rapping in a lot of music. But back then, it was a risk. So for her to sing like that early on, combined with the subject matter, the arrangement of the album with its throughline, and how it just flows with you\u2026 it\u2019s definitely a classic body of work.\n\n>It\u2019s a spiritual thing. The music feels like you\u2019re being brought towards it. You can feel the point of view. Black music to me is rooted in spiritual connectivity. If you look at rock and roll or blues or soul, we have been through so much, and that\u2019s being translated into music. When you listen to \u201cTo Zion,\u201d when you listen to \u201cNothing Even Matters,\u201d you feel the emotion put into it. As a whole, the album is just perfect.\n\n-\n\n>#The War on Drugs (Charlie Hall)\n**Meshell Ndegeocello\u2019s Ventriloquism (2018)**\n\n>Every five years or so, a record comes along and becomes a constant companion, a weekend guest who never leaves and simply becomes part of the family. Just as the Clientele Suburban Light and the Radio Dept.\u2019s Clinging to a Scheme before it, Meshell Ndegeocello's Ventriloquism turned me upside down and inside out. This is a record for any time, any day. Songs like \u201cDon\u2019t Disturb This Groove\u201d and \u201cI Wonder If I Take You Home\u201d and \u201cPrivate Dancer\u201d all reveal new emotional depths in Meshell\u2019s hands (to say nothing of this absolute monster of a band\u2014Abe, Chris, and Jebin. The spaciousness of the grooves and the delicacy of the playing have inspired me both musically and spiritually. It\u2019s pretty wild to hear an artist you thought you knew, playing songs you thought you knew. But it turns out to be beyond the magical beyond. In attempting to illuminate these songs, Meshell actually illuminates herself. Meshell belongs in the pantheon.\n\n-\n\n>#The War on Drugs (Dave Hartley)\n**D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Voodoo (2000)**\n\n>Voodoo by D\u2019Angelo is the one album that held my hand and helped me shake off the toxically masculine rock music with which I had been inundated in high school and early college, that opened a gateway in my mind to several galaxies of music, that completely turned my head around as a bass player, that still sounds fresh as a fucking daisy, that is at once welcomingly accessible and impossibly deep, that has never left the car-visor Case Logic CD organizer of my mind.\n\n-\n\n>#Zach Hill (Death Grips)\n**U.S. Maple\u2019s Acre Thrills (2001)**\n\n>I first saw U.S. Maple live in San Francisco opening for Pavement. This was at the Fillmore in 1999. Their album Talker had recently come out. Watching them that night, I could feel that I was gaining an access to myself that wasn\u2019t available to me beforehand. In performance, they were second to nothing I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n>I said to a friend afterward it was like a big pregnant snake on stage squeezing all the air from the room and doling out oxygen when it hissed. Then Acre Thrills came out in 2001, and I was consumed by it. As a fan, I consider their entire discography a consolidated masterpiece, but Acre Thrills fully peaked me.\n\n>In 2002, my band Hella opened for them at their Sacramento show date and I went on to reference that Fillmore performance when writing the lyrics to a Death Grips song called \u201cHacker\u201d: \u201cI got this pregnant snake, stay surrounded by long hairs, a plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs\u201d\u2014the pregnant snake being their performance, long hairs in reference to their first album Long Hair in Three Stages, and Spiral Stairs being the second guitarist in Pavement known as Spiral Stairs.\n\nVery influential.", {"entities": [[125, 134, "crypto"], [4100, 4109, "crypto"]]}], ["Game Thread: St Louis Blues at Colorado Avalanche -

How can Ethereum compete with that? \n\nOf course there are other coins that compete with avalanche. SOL and ALGO are pretty centralized compared to avalanche.

DeFi Kingdoms also has a decent sized UST LP that makes swapping for my favorite coins easy on Harmony.  Depending on liquidity issues and slippage sometimes going the direct way (Avalanche to Ethereum to Harmony) might be cheaper if you are moving large amounts of money.  For the average farmer though, avoiding ETH gas fees is normally the cheaper route.

But there is so much more. Many people have a burning question:\n\nHow will avax sustain its consensus after it has minted 720 million tokens? Why would anyone choose to stake avax after it has minted all 720 million avax tokens? Who will pay the validators?\n\nSooo let's talk about subnets:In Avalanche, transaction fees depending on the type of transaction. Instantiations of new subnetworks carry the heaviest fees. In contrast, other types of transactions, such as simple payments of $AVAX, carry little cost. For other subnets, transactions pay fees in that subnet\u2019s native token, as well as some amount in the $AVAX token. A transaction native to a subnetwork may specify its own transaction fee structure, and it is up to the creator of the subnet to choose a fee structure that incentivizes validation for open, permissionless subnetworks.\n\nTo be a validator for a subnet, you need to be a validator for avalanche. That means you need to be securing the avalanche blockchain in order to hose a subnet. That's it. That's ready set go for the game right there. Subnets are turing complete. Here is the thing. Today, we have dapps that use eth, and dapps that use other blockchains like fantom. But heres the catch. There is no universal language between them.\n\nThat's what makes the avalanche network special in a way ethereum can never be. Ethereum certainly can have dapps, but eth dapps can't do contract calls to say... for example solana. However, lets say you have a subnet thats running a solana evm, and is pushing the solana blockchain's data to the validators of that subnet. It would be able to natively talk to the solana blockchain. And that subnet could have functions called from the ethereum subnet, or the bnb subnet.\n\nThis is what makes avax so valuable, and most people don't even recognize the potential here, and have not even pondered what the purpose of avax is beyond low gas fees and being an \"eth killer\" Its not. Its an eth integrator. Avax is the going to become the defacto layer 2 for all blockchains if it gets its way.\n\nAnd a fair price for avax in this environment is easily over 2k. Avax will do what eth did in terms of price, and will come in at a solid #3 by marketcap within 5 years. I could even see avax flippen eth, if eth doesn't get its act together before the other blockchains catch up. Because if ANY of the other blockchains get close to eth, than eth will need a middle layer, and avax will be that middle layer.
