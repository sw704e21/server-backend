(vlx) is a state of the art open-sourced blockchain platform that is primarily focused on designing user-friendly interfaces. the project is based out of switzerland and is led by alex alexandrov. the team is composed of experienced engineers, mathematicians, and blockchain experts. the base-layer of velas is a solana fork that the team upgraded to meet a list of standards that included 50k transactions per second, near-zero transaction fees, and a finality of less than a second. to meet these rigorous demands, they designed a unique system of consensus they named aidpos, utilizing proof of stake and adding ai to improvement functionality. velas is simply fast, efficient, and nearly zero-cost to use.\n\none of the aspects that separated velas from solana, is the ability for ethereum developers to easily create on the platform. the platform allows for the deployment of evm dapps. to further improve on solana, they designed their platform to be seamless across all protocols on the blockchain. this will allow a user to have one account for all protocols without constant hassles of reconnecting wallets or approving every protocol before use. with these upgrades, velas is implementing the early stages of web 3.0, another of its main focuses.\n\nvelas has been very busy under the hood with close to 7k developer commits in the past year and over 1k in the past month. to give you an idea, the industry average is close to 1000 commits a year. they recently released a dex named wagyuswap, which looks like a pancake swap fork. they also released a decentralized social platform focused on usability, privacy, and monetization for the user named bitorbit. just like velas, neither project has garnered much attention.\n\ntheir documentation mentions decentralization various times. i hope that remains one of their priorities, but currently they are only running 50 nodes and 42 validators. this is common for the beginning stages of growth in a blockchain, and i would assume that as the network grows, so would the nodes/validators. only time will tell.\n\noddly enough, they are also partnered with solana in addition to a few other large firms. they recently had a $100 million incentive programs for developers, but it will probably take a few months to see the full affects of the program.\n\nevery aspect of velas looks impressive. from the technology, website, white paper, ideals and even their social media. they have combined a large team of professionals to embark on a common goal and it shows. i personally like what i see. the only major issue i have is the lack of volume in trading (8-10m). the low volume is caused by lack of major adoption of the network. since they have some important partners, i hope this improves over time. it is a great project with large upward potential that is currently lacking adoption. i do not see it catching up to similarly valued projects like eos, icon or one in the short term. it will likely grow with the market as a whole, but not outperform widely adopted projects around similar price points. velas overall is a recommended buy that will probably end up in the top 25-50 coins in the long run but monitoring for the correct time to buy is recommended.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frg8wr74qm181.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=924b4da24a760254043e842498e5b2b233e8b8d3\n\n# \n\n#

and wrote the famous bitcoin whitepaper. he began work on bitcoin in 2007 and went public in 2009 with the release of bitcoin.org. satoshi began speaking to leading members of the cypherpunk community to gather feedback on the project. satoshi worked in the background as a handful of people began taking interest in the project, and small communities began to emerge.\n\ncommunications with satoshi picked up as leading cypherpunks, engineers, and computer scientists began aiding in the bitcoin project. no one really knew the identity of satoshi. some evidence pointed toward him or a member of the team being of english descent. he used words such as \u201cbloody\u201d and preferred to work during gmt.\n\nin 2010, the new internet money named bitcoin took on value. two pizzas were purchased from papa johns for 10k bitcoins. in today\u2019s price, that would be $515m worth of bitcoin.\n\nin april 2011, satoshi handed control of bitcoin and the website to core developer gavin andresen. from that point, satoshi began to back away from the project and eventually disappeared completely. he has since been heard from. below is his last posted message. it is estimated that satoshi\u2019s

comparing it to the electricity usage of countries.\n\nthe next argument is usually that if btc spends y kwh right now with x tps, it has to spend 100y kwh to get to 100x tps. this generally happens when people do kwh/transaction calculations, either in bad faith, or because of ignorance.\n\nthis shows a complete lack of understanding of what bitcoin is, and what it does, and what mining is supposed to be.\n\nso first and foremost, cost per transaction is not a good metric to measure for bitcoin. bitcoin is more akin to a safe, than to a payment provider:\n\nlet's say you own 100 million dollars. you hold all of this money in different assets in a vault. you pay $50,000 per year for security. the only opened the vault once in 1 year since you had it. \n\nthis is the moment where bad faith actors come in, and say: \"you are spending $50,000 per transaction with your valut, this is incredibly inefficient\".\n\ni hope this has shown how elon musk \"not accepting transactions in bitcoin\", while still holding his position, is like the rich man trying to make his vault more efficient by not taking money or putting money into it. it's purely a pr stunt, since the money spent by miners is to secure the network, not to process transactions.\n\nnow that i've cleared up that using electricity usage per transaction is a metric is incredibly stupid, and the real thing we have to look at is the value secured by the network, some of you might have the following argument:\n\n> so the electricity used for securing the network goes up liniarily with the total value of the network, so if  bitcoin secures x amount of value now, and uses y electricity, when it grows and secures 100x value, it will use 100y electricity\n\nthe problem with this argument is that the main hypothesis is completely wrong, that being \"so the electricity used for securing the network goes up liniarily with the total value of the network\". the truth is that the amount of money spent on securing the network goes up liniarily with the total value of the network.\n\nthis small difference, 1 word, \"electricity\" and \"money\", makes a world of difference in the real world.\n\nyou might think they are synonymus in this situation, but when you spend some time to think about it, their differences become clear as day.\n\nour current electricity market doesn't have a means for arbitrage. if there is extremely cheap electricity in one place, and expensive electricity in another place, i cannot buy from the place where it's cheap, and sell it where it is expensive. this causes big portions of our electricity production to go to waste.\n\nbitcoin mining, by design, uses up the cheapest electricity first, so let's say we have this hypothetical situation (numbers not relevant, invented for the purpose of this thought experiment):\n\nthe electricity production market has these offers:\n\n- 200 twh at $0.02/kwh\n- 2000 twh at $0.30/kwh\n- 800 twh at $0.60/kwh\n\nbitcoin mining comes around, and uses up 50 twh from the cheapest, $0.02 source. people start to panic, saying that if bitcoin goes up 60x, it will use up all available electricity on earth.\n\nthe truth is that the cost to attack the network is dependant on the price of electricity, so if the power usage of mining went up to 200twh, and used up all of the cheap electricity, any attacker would have to spend a lot more money on an attack, since they would have to buy more expensive electricity. bitcoin mining can only expand as much as there is cheap electricity, since after that electricity is used up, there is absolutely no profit incentive to mine more, and attacking the network becomes exponentially harder. the effect is even more pronounced in the real world, where prices update dinamically based on supply and demand.\n\n\n\nthe simplest way to think about it is, if that electricity used by bitcoin mining was so important to civilization, and such a scarce resource, why is it so cheap? price is just the value we as humanity put on things. extremly cheap electricity is that cheap because it can't be used up by me or you, it is wasted.\n\n\nbut for a huge plot twist, bitcoin mining is actually good for the environment. this might sound crazy, but let me clarify through another hypothetical:\n\ni want to create a hydro electric powerplant next to a rapidly growing town. the current electricity usage of the town is 100kwh, and is projected to grow to 500kwh in the next 20 years.\n\nhow big should the plant be? if i bulid a power plant with a capacity of 500kwh capacity, part of the electricity won't be used for decades, and if i build it too small, i'll have to rebuild it in 20 years. at this moment, i might aswell build a coal power plant, which has a lot more leeway in the amount of coal i burn, and it's a lot more easily expandable.\n\nbut in comes bitcoin mining. i do build the 500kwh hydro powerplant, and use the excess electricity to mine bitcoin. this suddenly makes my investment profitable, making an investment in such a big green infrastructure project less risky, and when the town grows to the expected 500kwh power usage, mining becomes unprofitable, since selling that electricity to actual users gives more profit than using it with bitcoin miners.\n\nyou might think that bitcoin mining competing with consumer electricity usage would be a nightmare, and would cause your power bill to go up immensely. but this is completely wrong, the fact that mining makes the power plant more profitable, they can sell the electricity even cheaper to you, in order to undercut competitors, since they can subsidize the electricity you use with the profits made from mining while you aren't using electricity.\n\n\nconclusion:\n\nthe electricity usage concerns about cryptocurrency mining have been greatly exagerated by the media. before 2020, most people unanimously agreed with the arguments i made above. there has been an immense flood of people in this sub, and most people are trying to find \"the next big thing\", and tend to shit on bitcoin and ethereum in order to make their altcoin look better. \n\nmaking no-coiner arguments in order to make your alt look better just makes you look ignorant about how the most popular cryptocurrencies work, and what their incentive systems do. you might have a lot of yes-men agreeing with you in the bull run, but hopefully when the market crashes that will be a good learning experience.\n\ntl;dr: bitcoin mining isn't good because of whataboutism about other things that use a lot of electricity, it's good because it's a method for electricity price arbitrage, and a method to amortize investments into green energy.", {"entities": [[67, 74, "crypto"], [429, 436, "crypto"], [575, 582, "crypto"],

event when the pace at which new units of the world's largest cryptocurrency entering circulation is cut in half. \n\nit's part of an overall strategy to keep the maximum supply of bitcoins fixed, in contrast with fiat currencies like the us dollar, which have essentially unlimited supplies and lose value when governments print too much of it.\n\nhow does bitcoin halving work? \n\nto understand how bitcoin halving works, first you need to know the basics of how the cryptocurrency is created.\n\nbitcoins come into existence by way of a decentralised system, in which people known as miners use high-powered computer systems to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to verify and validate transactions on the bitcoin ledger, known as the blockchain. in return, they receive payment in the form of newly created bitcoins.\n\nbitcoin mining is a competition of sorts. miners are essentially racing to be first to add new blocks to the blockchain. for each block added, they receive a certain number of new bitcoins as a reward. the originator of bitcoin programmed the block reward to be cut in half at regular intervals.\n\nthe reward for mining a block is reduced by half for every 210,000 blocks added. it currently takes some four years to add that many blocks, so bitcoin halving has been occurring at approximately four-year intervals. the latest and third halving took place in may 2020. the next is expected in 2024.\n\nwhy do bitcoin halvings occur? \n\nalthough who actually created bitcoin remains a mystery, it is believed that the platform was put together in a way that would make it a deflationary currency \u2014 with purchasing power that increases over time.\n\nwith the halvings resulting in decreased mining rewards, creating new bitcoins becomes an increasingly expensive proposition. as time goes on, each coin becomes more and more valuable. this contrasts with currencies like the us dollar, which invariably lose their purchasing power over time.\n\nanother theory for the rationale behind bitcoin halving is that the cryptocurrency's creator wanted to have a larger proportion of coins being generated early on to entice people to join the network as miners.\n\nwhat happens to bitcoin prices during halving?\n\nhistorical data shows a correlation between bitcoin halving and increases in the price of bitcoin. of course, price is affected not just by halvings, but by a whole host of factors. here's a summary of what happened around the first three halving events:\n\nfirst halving: at the time of the first halving, in november 2012, the price of bitcoin stood at about $11. within a year, it rose a hundredfold.\n\nsecond halving: in july 2016, the bitcoin network arrived at the milestone of 420,000 blocks, triggering a second halving. the price of bitcoin fluctuated between $500 and $1,000 for a few months, and ultimately rose to around $20,000 by december 2017.\n\nthird halving: the third halving happened in may 2020, coinciding with another bull run for the cryptocurrency. at the time of this halving, bitcoin traded at around $9,000. it climbed to around $30,000 by the end of the year.\n\nonly three of the 64 total halvings scheduled to take place prior to 2140 have occurred.\n\nthe last halving is predicted to occur in 2140, after which block rewards will not be in the form of bitcoins. instead, miners will be rewarded with fees from

plain sight, meaning even if someone finds the media that contains the seed phrase, it wouldn't be clear that it's a seed phrase. this would help with the cases when someone wants to hide his seed phrase so much that at the end he can't access it because of a small mistake. of course some of these are just for laughs, but i think some might be useful for the community. please enjoy. this is not

you better, you can write a simple song, hide your words - for example every important word is sang by another person, or another pitch - and mail it to yourself, upload it to youtube, soundcloud,

these rewards platforms, it is faster than other methods. basic idea is instead of using cashback when you shop, this platform convert rewards amount and pays users in crypto of their choice directly into their public wallet address. they are also quickest to setup and start earning as there are no pre-requisites or verification, unlike other platforms.\n\ni found two great platforms. tuktuk crypto & storm-x. both are good and does their job well but i found tuktuk crypto to have more merchants and a higher rewards percentage. i am based in australia, that might be the case as storm-x is targeted towards the us and more us stores. also, tuktuk has region-based stores. that means if you are living in india, you will see stores only available in india. i think stormx offers bitcoin and ethereum to withdraw. tuktuk offers top 30 coins by market cap as mentioned on their website.\n\nopinion: i shop all my stuff online like households, groceries, mostly from amazon, asos, ali express, etc. my regular shopping schedule collects $30-$40 easily in a month in rewards. again, goal is not to spend more for crypto but making the best out of it without spending much time. for anyone

nano):**\n\ni guess i don't need to go in detail for folks here. moon is the crypto coins used by  [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/)  \nto reward users who post quality contents, and comments. they pay out once a month and moons are distributed based on karma earned. \n\nthis is one way to earn crypto on reddit. there could be other subs issuing their own coins as rewards like nano but haven't tried it yet.\n\nopinion: earning decent amount of moon is really feasible and effective as you can earn by posting high quality contents on the topics you love. you can check the current top earners on the side menu of the main page in this sub. as of posting now, u/thetruebluetj, u/deathbyfish, and the rest are top earners who earned 4,313 moons. wanna be on the

effective way is by bat tokens earned by using brave browsers. brave is a free browser to download and use - essentially an alternative to chrome or firefox. and as an actual browser. in addition to blocking ads, brave (if you allow it to) will send you ads of their own and give you the revenue in crypto. it is easy to set up - simpler if you have an uphold account - and i found the ads to be unobtrusive.\n\nopinion: have been using brave for almost a year now and accumulated 50 bat. it converts to usd 53 at the current bat price. that is impressive considering the ads time it saved me and

different coin projects as they want users to try them. once earned enough, users can transfer to their coinbase or other wallet and exchange for btc.\n\ncoinbase is slower as the verification process is lengthy. but they have many projects to pick from. coinmarketcap is quicker with verification but lower-paying projects.\n\nopinion: i did a stellar project course and earned $10 in xlm in like 15 mins of watching on coinbase. not bad but it depends on the project. once i earn enough, it will be deposited into the coinbase wallet or transferred into crypto of your choice.\n\ncoinmarketcap is slower with payout. you need a binance wallet to withdraw the funds. i'd prefer coinbase between these two.\n\ncoinbase:

cs go and earning nano. it's not much but i just play anyway. if one has enough time in their hands, they can watch or play all the available games on their website or they offer.\n\ni have read users earning up to $3-$5 in crypto per day. that's not bad i think.\n\nopinion: so i haven't been able to play all or use all of the games/faucets. the incentives are very low in my case or not as great as

claiming to earn free crypto. one of them i tried was 'free litecoin' for a month app. i had to log in and hit a button that spins and decides if you won free coins or not. i did it 3-4 times a day and once every 2 days. these are randomized app ads they show and just give you a fraction they earn in crypto.\n\nopinion: after like a month of playing, i made 10,250 ltc. they have a withdrawal limit of 100,000 ltc which comes to around 10 months of playing at my speed. once enough, users can withdraw to their wallet and exchange for crypto of your choice.   \n\n\ntheir many other similar games, apps on app stores which i assume works the same way. it will take a lot of time to gain realizable. \n\nin summary, i think the above order gives you the best return for your time spent on trying to earn btc for free. there are other many ways like staking your crypto, nfts or airdrops but i don't think it is affordable, especially for beginners. so i won't mention\n\nfeel free to share

on the fringe started adopting, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have grown to dominate the news, create fanatic followings in social media, and worry governments about where this is all headed.\n\nwhile some think that bitcoin is just a highly speculative asset, a group of strong believers termed \u201cmaximalists\u201d project that bitcoin will become a dominant global currency that overthrows the dollar one day. though initially sceptical, researching this article took me down a rabbit-hole\u2026\n\nwhat is bitcoin? where does its value come from? does it have the properties needed to make it a viable form of currency? can it fuel a thriving economy? what are bitcoin\u2019s weak points? which are its competitors? how will governments respond to its rise to power? can bitcoin become the new gold standard?\n\nstrap in for a rollercoaster ride through the past, present and future of bitcoin!\n\na brief history of money\n\nhistorians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. think about that. we were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. the origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.\n\nmoney served three purposes:\n\n* a store of wealth across time. people could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.\n* a medium of exchange, to procure things from others.\n* a unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.\n\nstarting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** there was a problem with this system, though. you guessed it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pu2wpgj9j181.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac1cc0fcb67bfdbb88bb05a99b0b9912b5c42dd4\n\npeople who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* this is what happened in africa when glass beads merchants from europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (this could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).\n\n**gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. mining gold is a difficult task. flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. but the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.\n\ngovernments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. this has always worked fine until it hasn't. as long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. but the people who are closest to the means of production of money - kings, central bankers, cabinet members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. this can be seen in the case of the fall of rome and constantinople, the hyperinflation in zimbabwe, the shift of the us and other countries away from the gold standard \\[1\\], and the inflation that is looming over the us right now.\n\nlooking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?\n\n* **convenient to handle.** it should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. units should be interchangeable (fungible).\n* **credible.** the validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the government).\n* **liquid.** it should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.\n* **secure.** if the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.\n* **inflation resistant.** it should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.\n* **stable.** the value should not have significant volatility.\n\nthe most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. if an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.\n\n**how does bitcoin do on these grounds?** let us start by understanding what bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.\n\nbitcoin\n\nbitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** let's unpack that.\n\n* **bitcoin is decentralized.** there is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of bitcoin.\n* **bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \\- a form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.\n* **bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \\- there is no reliance on a central banking system.\n* **bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \\- a copy of every transaction ever made on the bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! but because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.\n\nbitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named satoshi nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. satoshi open-sourced the code to bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, satoshi vanished mysteriously.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0b5w8jpl9j181.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4163594c2280db18d36ed9303edf3571c72b4017\n\nto the layman, bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. to use bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). this is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. there is no central authority over bitcoin.\n\neach bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called satoshis for convenience.\n\nsince 2008, bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. but...\n\nwhere does bitcoin get its value from?\n\nwe saw earlier that if it\u2019s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. this was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).\n\nthe government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. imagine you have a million dollars and it\u2019s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. that's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **there is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as \"hard money\"**, whose supply is restricted.\n\nthat's one of bitcoin's chief attractions. bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. each block that needs to be added to the bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \\[2\\] bitcoins are produced by \"miners\" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. when miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in bitcoins**. this is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otsv8j0n9j181.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0773966819484ef11c5865f0177bc02d22e6ae\n\nthe physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. the second feature is that **there can be only 21 million bitcoins in existence**, ever. this is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \\[3\\] 20 million bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). by 2140, all of the bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. as the supply of bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.\n\nthere is no central authority for bitcoin. the code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. for example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \\[4\\]. but when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like bitcoin cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing bitcoin cash's value to drop sharply. hence, **bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**\n\nthe above points show that bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).\n\nthis tells us about the **perceived value** of bitcoin, but if the aim of bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:\n\n1. liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies\n2. fuel for a thriving economy\n3. stable\n\nhow does bitcoin do on these fronts?\n\nliquidity\n\nlet's be real here. most people are interested in bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. it's because of the **\u201cnumber go up\u201d** that every influencer is shouting about on twitter as if it\u2019s their personal achievement. that's the reason bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **how is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**\n\nthe misconception here is that bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** the problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**\n\nthe story around bitcoin is this:\n\n**\u201cbitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.\u201d**\n\npeople who adhere to this vision are called **bitcoin maximalists.** and in terms of the stories out there, bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. it makes sense. when personal incentive is tied with a story, the fomo kicks in of being penniless when bitcoin takes over. the possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **and as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**\n\n**bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. decentralization.**\n\nthough bitcoin claims to be \u201cdecentralized\u201d, that's only if bitcoin becomes money in itself. to convert from dollar to bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** these exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. for example, tether, which debuted as a *stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \\[5\\] tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **it is one of the biggest intermediaries for bitcoin to dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**\n\nof course, bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. but is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? shouldn't bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**\n\nthe bitcoin economy - and competitors\n\none of the biggest jokes in the history of bitcoin was when laszlo hanyecz of florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. that would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \\[6\\] but that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with bitcoin.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eermktbp9j181.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5df9448e1eaa7b010addbdc12f498f2485577d7\n\nsince then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of bitcoin as a mode of payment. from retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\\[7\\] there's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with bitcoin.** but there are things that you **cannot** buy with bitcoin yet. there's no direct provision to buy stocks on the nasdaq (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.\n\na big market for bitcoin is their programmability - **smart contracts will automate the market of trust.** people don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. a clause like \u201cif rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance\u201d can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. but this is also a space where bitcoin has tough competition.\n\nethereum, solana, cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *altcoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that bitcoin couldn\u2019t. bitcoin maximalists argue that bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, bitcoin can absorb into its code - but the facts speak otherwise. when ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of bitcoin\u2019s, but after ether started catering to the nft and dao space, **it's now a serious threat to bitcoin\u2019s dominance**. other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to bitcoin. dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [i'm looking at you, elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)\n\nbut one thing is for sure - it\u2019s very difficult for a new entrant to the altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that bitcoin does.*** there is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. and that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.\n\n**it's not money unless everyone believes it is.**\n\na strong warning is in place here: when i say a new cryptocurrency is useless, i\u2019m talking about the long term. coin offerings have a very strong possibility of being a ponzi scheme, so be very very careful with where you put your money.\n\nthere's just one more reason that bitcoin and other altcoins are still not widespread in their use.\n\nvolatility\n\nbitcoin is very volatile compared to the us dollar. this is something that even maximalists don't argue with. it is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. this is the reason bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:\n\n>a 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hashtag_click)\ud83d\udcf7 for his birthday. dad can i please have just one bitcoin for my birthday as a gift ? father: what ? why the hell you need $ 14,433 do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. what would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?\n\nbut the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (the figures are based on growth in market cap, number of users, and number of transactions - unreliable, because one individual can have any number of bitcoin addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of bitcoin, not retail transactions).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pcejw8hr9j181.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=df0cfd7a129561830c11ccdf87082b664067f59e\n\nhere we enter the realm of speculation. we must understand that bitcoin is the first of its kind - a resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of bitcoin, rather than a bug. \\[9\\] supporters of bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (how exactly? i\u2019m not sure. i don't have enough know-how to assess this).\n\nall this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.\n\nwill the government be sleeping?\n\nbitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the government has over money. el salvador has accepted bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first \"bitcoin city\". what on earth is going on?\n\nin the standard narrative about bitcoin, after bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some central bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up bitcoin and rapid adoption of bitcoin follows suit with bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. this phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**\n\nthat sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose bitcoin: **the government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase bitcoin scalably. how will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? there seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.\n\nthere is no doubt that bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. even now, [bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with ether at 25th). world countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **it is highly likely that bitcoin (or other altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** but instead of bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate bitcoin into their legal framework.** bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \\[10\\] though the indian and chinese governments banned bitcoin, india is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. the lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of bitcoin.**\n\nand though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. the real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \\[11\\]. hopefully, it doesn't get that far.\n\na bitcoinized world: good, bad or ugly?\n\nthe advantages of bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:\n\n1. greater freedom of the individual\n2. resistance to inflation\n3. delegation of trust to a mathematical system\n4. reduction in government interference\n\nthe notion of decentralization has created this idea that bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. there are some counterpoints to that argument:\n\n1. the initial distribution of bitcoin is hugely skewed. by some accounts, 85% of the entire bitcoin supply is in the hands of \"whales\" who constitute just 2% of the user base (but this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the bitcoin economy develops). \\[12\\]\n2. though bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the internet.\n3. bitcoiners\u2019 claim that bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. there is no clear data on how many people believe in bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**\n4. it isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \\[13\\]. the hope is that the political neutrality of bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.\n5. governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.\n\nso will we see bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?\n\ncan bitcoin replace the dollar?\n\nif we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. it has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 trillion in **a mere 13 years (apple computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** since bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.\n\nbitcoin\u2019s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. though there is tough competition, some of bitcoin\u2019s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g meta tried to start its own currency libra/diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. ethereum isn\u2019t truly decentralized either).\n\nthe real challenges for bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** people will only consider bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. till then, it\u2019s an asset at most. although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like nfts seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.\n\nprice stability is also more likely when bitcoin has a strong native economy. there are different assertions about its stability - that high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. the truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it\u2019s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven\u2019t seen anything like this before.**\n\ngovernment regulation is the biggest factor. without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the \u201cglobal currency\u201d that it claims to be. some milestones to watch out for would be:\n\n* the first central bank to store bitcoin as reserve currency.\n* clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to bitcoin.\n* stock exchanges trading bitcoin as a commodity on par with gold and oil.\n\nif any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. but with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**\n\nconclusion\n\nthough the american dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. the first american dollars were minted in 1792. but it was only in the aftermath of world war 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!\n\non the contrary, bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. it's questionable

will continue to be 4-year cycles with decreasing volatility\n* you will be able to earn an average 2% yield on your bitcoin (see: gemini, ledn, celsius, etc.)\n* you retire in 2022\n* your average us income tax rate is 25%\n* your loan's interest rate is 8% using a max 40% collateral position each year\n* you need $60,000 a year to retire comfortably\n* early on, you take loans (and refinance them each year with the additional income needed)\n* you want to eventually live off yield alone\n* excess yield in the future will be applied towards loan repayment\n\nhow much bitcoin would you need to utilize for earning yield and also used as loan collateral?\n\n**answer for this example:** 8.5 bitcoin.  i wanted to find an amount that would, over time, allow me to generate enough yield to repay the loan and eventually end up with the same amount of bitcoin that i started with.\n\nthis amount can be drastically lowered if you retired at a later year if bitcoin's price is much higher.

volume processed has grown massively. i was curious at what point it becomes as big of a network in terms of volume as some financial household names.\n\nit's important to note that i'm not talking about replacing mastercard or visa. bitcoin is more of a \"savings technology\" rather than a \"spending (more than you have) technology\". it's not only technically very different, but caters to different uses.\n\nwith that said, let's take a look at the 2021 quarterly volumes:\n\n|network|average quarterly volume in 2021|\n|:-|:-|\n|bitcoin|$489 billion|\n|paypal|$302 billion|\n|mastercard|$1.8 trillion|\n|visa|$3.2 trillion|\n\nin graph form, looking back a bit further:\n\n[bitcoin's data sourced from blockchain.com's estimated btc tx volume in usd, the others

volume by 260% to be on par with mastercard and 540% to be on par with visa in terms of volume. while that doesn't sound like much, it is a lot.\n\nthere are 3 factors that could get bitcoin to such levels:\n\n1. the number of transactions rises.\n2. the average amount of bitcoin sent per transaction rises.\n3. the bitcoin price rises.\n\nfactor #1 is likely to be (part of) the answer, but is technically complex to determine due to the privacy provided by scalability solutions such as the lightning network. i go more in-depth on this in [the full article](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/bitcoin-volume-mastercard-visa).\n\nas for factor #2 & 3: there is an unsurprising inverse correlation between the bitcoin price and the average btc sent per transaction. this means that as the bitcoin price goes up, the average btc that is transferred goes down.\n\n[data sourced from

settlement layer, while payments increasingly move to solutions built on top of it such as the lightning network, then we could see this trend reverse.\n\nuntil such a time, the bitcoin price would need to rise substantially more than 260% for the processed volume to be at mastercard level. however, taking this inverse correlation into account would complicate the model and still not account for many other potential factors such as increased inflation, new technological breakthroughs, corporate or sovereign adoption, etc.\n\nif we just take the 260% as an indicator however, and plot out 3 basic growth trends (that have no guarantee by any means to continue in their path of course), then you arrive at a time range of 2026-2060s for the bitcoin network to process an equivalent to that of the mastercard network. if the price were to grow at the minimum price increase per year rate, it would stay on par with the mastercard network.\n\n[bitcoin data sourced from

revealed that over two thirds of cryptocurrency investors borrowed money to make their purchase, rather than using income and/or savings.  \n\n\noverall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so.  \n\n\ncryptocurrencies are highly volatile and a risky way to invest large sums of money. bitcoin, for example, has been in the news in recent weeks as it reached a value of over $64,000 (approx.. \u00a347,800). this would have undoubtedly brought in new investors as they try to take advantage of the price increase. however, in

were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds to make their investment, with a significant drop of borrowers in the two highest age groups.  \n\n\nwhat type of credit facilities have people used to fund cryptocurrency investments?  \n\n\nwhen we break down what kinds of credit facilities people have used to purchase cryptocurrencies, over a third (35.5%) made their investment using a credit card. almost a fifth (19.3%) funded the purchase out of their overdraft.  \n\n\ncredit card: 35.5%  \noverdraft: 19.3%  \npersonal loan: 14.6%  \nsecured loan: 9%  \npayday loan: 7.6%  \nre-mortgage: 3.3%  \n\n\nholly andrews, managing director at [kis finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/), comments on the findings.  \n\n\n\u201cin recent years, cryptocurrencies have become far more mainstream with tech giant paypal now offering a cryptocurrency trading platform.  \n\n\nalthough cryptos, and specifically bitcoin, have seen people make thousands or even millions in profit; the last week or so has shown that they are incredibly volatile and can see investors losing massive percentages of what they put in very quickly.  \n\n\nit\u2019s concerning that so many people have turned to borrowed funds to purchase cryptocurrencies as they are extremely unpredictable and offer no guarantees that the money invested will be returned. so, if people are spending money that they don\u2019t have, and losing it, this could cause some serious financial challenges later down the line.  \n\n\nthe biggest concern is whether people will have the ability to pay the money back. with a very strong possibility of losing the money for good, people may be left severely out of pocket and racking up interest on their credit cards and overdrafts. also, some credit card providers will view this type of transaction as a cash advance, meaning a cash advance fee and higher interest rate will be applied.  \n\n\nso, if you are thinking of making an investment into cryptocurrencies, you should only invest an amount of money that you can afford to lose and it should be funded through income and/or savings rather than a credit facility.  \n\n\nborrowing money to invest in cryptos can become a very vicious cycle that\u2019s difficult to break. once you start losing money, it can be very tempting to invest more to make the money back; especially if you don\u2019t have other means of repaying the funds.  \n\n\ngreat care should be taken when you invest money anywhere, but especially when it\u2019s something as volatile as cryptocurrencies. if you can, seek some professional financial advice first and never invest more than you can afford. buying cryptocurrencies should also not be your only form of investment or savings as there is very little

project was a success. in our experience, you can actually pay with btc (almost) everywhere in el zonte.\n\nbeer, coffee, the national dish pupusas - everything is available for satoshis. as a rule, payment works via qr codes that are displayed at the stands.\n\nnevertheless, bitcoin beach is a success. especially the younger, tech-savvy population uses sats more often than, say, credit card payments on site. this is not least because bitcoin works without a bank account. previously, the economy was primarily based on cash us dollars. to make things easier once again, the team around bitcoin beach has even decided to set up its own wallet, the - how could it be otherwise - bitcoin beach wallet. it is freely available in the app store and android store and works flawlessly.\n\nin addition to sending and receiving satohis, there are also features like location search of stores that accept btc payments as well as a beginner-friendly guide into the bitcoin rabbit hole.\n\nbitcoin beach can rightfully be called the nucleus of salvadoran bitcoin law. that's because in addition to peterson's team, strike also spent time in the town earlier this year promoting bitcoin adoption.

(ups and downs). my start was rough, for the first 3 months i was bleeding, always in red. seemed like odds are against me.\n\nas i was just getting started, it was super slow and seemed complex. everything felt scary, i had 0 confidence in what i am doing, but i had a gut feeling, a desire slowly becoming obsession. i went through different phases on this journey, and i want to share my experience so far with you guys, with a hope that it can be useful for anyone reading it.\n\ni will go through all my phases in the article below, good and bad, without any restraint, with a conclusion and tips at the end!\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**phase 1 - the beginning - newbie day trader**\n\n&#x200b;\n\nthis might be the most common way everyone started/will start. i have heard on social media/chit chats/news about a crypto currency called doge (bare in mind that i have heard about btc long ago, but in my country montenegro, there is only a dozen of investors in crypto). i got interested, and after a few days i found myself looking for a way to purchase it.\n\nafter some research i found that i can download binance app on my phone (i tried coinbase first, but it is not supported in my country), did the kyc and i could start depositing. that's how i put 15 euros, and bought my first crypto ever. over the next few days it started rising and i was getting euphoric, as my investment doubled. i had no idea how market works, what's market cap/supply/cycles etc. luckily,   i was here, on this thread since start and started picking up quite a few useful informations. i found about coinbureau's youtube channel (among many other trading/shilling ones) at that time also, so that's quite a headstart, when i look back.\n\nas i was learning about spot trading, first thing that crossed my mind was short term swings (lol). i have noticed that the market is very volatile, and tought that i can get the advantage of it.\n\nfast forward a month i have put a couple of hundreads, finding myself day trading on ada/matic (after many other everyday going back and forth from one coin to another, without any knowledge on projects, just based on what i hear from diferent sources). at the end of may, the bleeding started, panic selling after 5% dips, rebuying after 5% ups, chasing trades, basic buy high/sell low meme newbie trader. i was down 20-30% on my initial investment.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**phase 2 - learning/strategic investing - dca'ing and staking (off-chain), moon farming**\n\n&#x200b;\n\ni understood that i am not capable of day trading, competing against automated bots/experienced traders is hard. browsing around here i saw \"dca, dca, dca\" on every and each post. started wondering what's that, and the rest is history. i picked a few coins (eth/ada), and decided to put regularly (every few days/week) smaller ammounts, whenever i can, not so concerned about the price of coins at the moment.\n\ni started accumulating, patiently, even though my portfolio was in red, never saw green pastures since my first 15 dollars doge investment. i have learned about binance staking mechanisms. i started to stake my ada/eth, and felt super nice. i was too noob to stake on-chain, but the locked stake mechanism kept me from panicking at the very least (pretty useful for newbies, when i look back). i found out about beth/eth trading pair, where i could trade my eth for staked version (binance ethereum beth) while immidiately getting 3-8% more of my eth bag, and staking it for 5-6% interest. felt great.\n\nall this time i have never stopped researching, reading about everything, started to open whitepappers, found out about - \"rainbow chart\", \"greed index\", \"alt coin season index\" etc.\n\nover time getting deeper and deeper into this rabbit hole. at this point, i knew i will never sell on loss, as you really never loose anything unless you sell. i was in a state of peace, slowly building my position and portfolio.\n\nthis went for a few months (june-july-august).\n\n*i have learned about moon farming in this phase, and i did it for a couple of months. i got hooked up. was sorting posts on this sub by \"new\", and just commenting, lol! open you vault, guys. it is super easy!*\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**phase 3 - confidence rising - first use of smart contracts, riskier investments, on-chain interactions**\n\n&#x200b;\n\ndurring my accumulation period i have started gaining interest on smart contracts. i found out that my eth is of no use there, since for the ammount i had was not worth using it on-chain. naturally, as i use binance, i begun looking around binance smart chain possibilites. everything was new, exciting, many coins, tokens, etc. there i have learned about swaps, dex'es, smart contract's use, and for the first time heard of defi.\n\ni started using on-chain staking for my ada (yoroi wallet, chrome extension). found my first delegators, super exciting.\n\nthan, my first smart contracts touch in practice. cryptoblades, binance smart chain's, game. installed my metamask wallet chrome extension, went on their website, and connected it. transfered bnb from binance to metamask, swapped on some dex my bnb for native token and boom, i was doing it! unreal at the start, play to earn game, entered with 150 euros, bought some heroes, weapons, and puff - i was making 20-30 dollars each day before you say it. my grand plans came due to the state of euphoria, greed kicked in. but some inner gut feeling made me not reinvest everything, because i wanted to get my principal investment back out. no need to say, this turned out to be really too good to be true, massive dillution of native token, and massive cheap/free minting ruined game economy, and after a month of my enter price completely crashed, without any rewards liquidity. atleast, i was not on big loss, maybe 10% ( but it's positive zero, gained experience and exposure to on-chain mechanisms). big step for me!\n\nall this time my ada/eth was patiently hodl'ed. mid august is the time when market started gaining some traction. confidence returned, fud around btc stopped, ethereum started getting upgrades, ada was on fire cuz of smart contract hype. my portfolio stopped bleeding, and for the first time about lucky first doge investment my position was in green! no need to say, i was feeling great! momentum was on my side.\n\ni was starting to be experimental, looking for new coins with \"fundamentals\", looking for coins that, in my opinion, would be in demand. naturally for me, as i was into cardano's ecosystem, i understood that because of smart contracts about to be implemented new projects will start to show up. that's where i did my first x8 (at the end i cashed out on x5). i have found a future dex token - adax, where i put around 30% of my portfolio at the time.\n\ni have never invested in a shit/meme coin! might not be the wisest from the return on investment point when i look back now, but i stay away from them.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**phase 4 - my first gather of profits - very important!**\n\n&#x200b;\n\ndon't get overly attached, be ready to move, act like a nomad!\n\n&#x200b;\n\ni understood that the market is pretty speculative (i was super attached to cardano/eth), and as i was going more and more on the green side, other type of panic took place. i was nervous on not realising my profits patiently earned. i have understood that a good time (and hardest) to take the profit is at all time highs. we have to be humble! at this time i already knew about opportunity cost, and didn't want to ride a wave down. i wanted to reinvest somewhere else. after smart contract \"release\" hype i started dca'ing out of cardano, and sold most between 3-2$ dollars, in profit. i did the same with eth, sold 4k+ (all of it). i kept some ada for staking in meld pools (future lending/borrowing platform on cardano), as i will get rewards at the start of december in their token.\n\nthis might not be the best for everyone, that's was just my gut feeling, that turned out to be the right move, as my reinvestment did much better.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**phase 5 - entering defi space (decentralized finance) - farming**\n\n&#x200b;\n\nthis is where i am at now. this is a world full of possibilites, but not many utilize it. some say it's riskier, but i know for certain it's scary for unexperienced investors. a lot of new terminology and strategies.\n\ndefi, in my opinion, will lead our beloved crypto market (if it is not already, lol). it gives even more trust in crypto. traditional finance are past. try some defi, and see for yourself.\n\nto position yourself as a house/bank, and gather those juicy interests feel great. liquidity porviding/lending/borrowing is a great mechanism to use, to upgrade your potential of coins you hodl anyway.\n\nafter you enter this space, and discover all the protocols on many chains that use smart contracts, you will understand demmand/supply much better!\n\nfor example - you might saw avax run up, but don't understand why it's happening. it is not random! you need that avax to enter on-chain defi. there are numerous great protocols, with competent developers, doing wonders. litreally, when you provide liquidity, that protocol (each has their own setup) utilize your money to make more money, while giving you back as a reward usually great interest. you can also get a percentage from swaps/trades happening on that dex, depends on the smart contracts you interact with.\n\nthere are many more great chains: luna, harmony, fantom, besides  avax, have the most to offer. i didn't include eth's layer 2 solutions, as i don't find them as attractive atm. ethereum main chain is great, but you need tens of thousands worth to utilize it properly (gas fees are enormous, as we all know). solana have some badass defi protocols aswell, but didn't use it yet.\n\nsome new chains with defi that i am looking forward to use are: algorand, cardano (soon, i hope) and elrond.\n\ncurrently, i am on avax and harmony ecosystem. reaping some nice yields there. unimaginable for me before, 3 digits apr's, and with compounding that apy becomes unreal. but i am careful. i take care of my profits.\n\ni'm pretty vigilant, as 35-40% of my portfolio is in stable coins. some are paired providing liquidity, and some are lended, and borrowed back to stack apr.\n\ni actually make around 66% apr currently on 1usdc (on harmony chain). you can do it by stacking, wich is a great strategy on this chain, since transaction fees are super low (0.001 cents) and fast.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**conclusion:**\n\n&#x200b;\n\n\\- you can start without any knowledge about crypto, and with passion and love you can find your way around, in this world.\n\n\\- patience is the name of the game. the least emotions you have, the better is for you.\n\n\\- experimentation will lead you to greatness. you need practice if you want to go advanced! find a cheap and fast chain, and use that crypto for you. money makes money. if you don't use it, you are not doing it properly.\n\n\\-  try to go on-chain. make a wallet, metamask or something, write your seed phrases, that's you crypto now! hell, just begin with on-chain staking, it secures the chain you believe in and hold!\n\n\\- if there is no defi on the chain - price action will suffer, at least currently. but that might be a good time to enter, since after protocols start to arise demmand will follow. follow your reasearch!\n\n\\- be careful out there, if you are on defi side, there are protocols rising like mushrooms everywhere!\n\n\\- protect your profits, dca out the same as you dca in. it adds up!\n\n\\- before putting money somewhere you need to check the pulse! join discord, read their twitter, check market cap/supply, vesting period, team/develpores, whitepapper, utility of native coin/token.\n\n\\- community is a great factor of every project!\n\n&#x200b;\n\n \n\n***these are general things i use to check general state of market every

from mining\n - an appreciation of bitcoin's price\n\nthe risk/reward here for them is enormous. will the shanty town of corrugated metal huts and its people move willingly? will enough private

double from where it is today, they will have made the best move in their small country's history. they'll have more or less financed a city from a swamp, improved tens of thousands of lives in the

once the desired trade is made, withdraw your bitcoin and any other crypto and keep it in your personal wallet.\n\n**keep backup**\n\nwhile storing your private keys/seed for your wallet, it is always a good idea to keep backup.\n\n**use separate wallets for daily use and savings**\n\nwhile storing bitcoin, it is never a good idea to store all your bitcoin in one place. split them into different wallets and categorize them for *daily use, savings, trading, etc.* this way if one wallet gets compromised the rest of your bitcoin is safe. \n\n**never click or access unverified bitcoin

([https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-bitcoin-etf](https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-bitcoin-etf))\n\na common argument i've seen against using bitcoin etfs is the fact that \"paper bitcoin\" can dangerously affect bitcoin's value. to address that concern, the following info is found on the front page of the btcc.b etf linked above:\n\n>physically settled and safely held in cold storage  \nthis isn\u2019t just a claim to paper like bitcoin futures, it\u2019s the real deal. when you buy the etf, we buy real bitcoin with your money. by holding this etf, you hold actual bitcoin in your portfolio.\n\nfurthermore, the etf is sold on regulated brokerage platforms with access to the canadian investor protection fund (cipf) protection if the brokerage becomes insolvent: [https://www.cipf.ca/](https://www.cipf.ca/)\n\nif something happens to the fund itself (btcc.b), my understanding is that your shares would get liquidated to canadian dollars instead, aka you'd get money back based on how many shares you owned. i could be wrong on this part, so please correct me (with evidence) if this is wrong.\n\nso what does all of the above mean? it means that canadians have a safe and easy way to get exposure into bitcoin via etfs, while also being protected by cipf, and without negatively influencing the value of bitcoin since real bitcoin is bought for each share purchased (with btcc.b).\n\nas a final remark, i'm not against hardware wallets; i think they're a great option, especially when you're familiar enough with how bitcoin works. however, we need to be realistic and consider the safest way for people (aging population, non-tech savvy users) to get exposure, and in my opinion, that's by using etfs.", {"entities": [[117, 124, "crypto"], [198, 205,

bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have grown to dominate the news, create fanatic followings in social media, and worry governments about where this is all headed.\n\nwhile some think that bitcoin is just a highly speculative asset, a group of strong believers termed \u201cmaximalists\u201d project that bitcoin will become a dominant global currency that overthrows the dollar one day. though initially sceptical, researching this article took me down a rabbit-hole\u2026\n\nwhat is bitcoin? where does its value come from? does it have the properties needed to make it a viable form of currency? can it fuel a thriving economy? what are bitcoin\u2019s weak points? which are its competitors? how will governments respond to its rise to power? can bitcoin become the new gold standard?\n\nstrap in for a rollercoaster ride through the past, present and future of bitcoin!\n\na brief history of money\n\nhistorians agree that humans invented money before they invented written language. think about that. we were able to agree on how to exchange value before we were able to write down our thoughts. the origins of money are more fundamental to human nature than our desire to communicate, in a way.\n\nmoney served three purposes:\n\n* a store of wealth across time. people could store today's effort for using it tomorrow.\n* a medium of exchange, to procure things from others.\n* a unit of account, to record credit-debit relationships.\n\nstarting with the barter system, humans moved on to using common goods with intrinsic value (such as cows and bags of wheat) and then to units like cowrie shells, glass beads which were more convenient for accounting because of their **divisibility.** there was a problem with this system, though. you guessed it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7akckhof8j181.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=07d44f3848d3904a377476bbb822816264b4a38c\n\npeople who had access to the means of production of cowrie shells or glass beads could flood the market, *and the more money there was in the market, the less value it had.* this is what happened in africa when glass beads merchants from europe imported loads of glass beads and made them worthless as a form of money. (this could be one of the first recorded instances of **inflation**).\n\n**gold** was a solution to the cheap creation of money. mining gold is a difficult task. flooding the supply of money was difficult unless people took the effort to mine gold, for which they were compensated. but the quality of gold could always be debased and there was no way to check its authenticity.\n\ngovernments took on the responsibility of **controlling the supply** and **guaranteeing the validity** of money. this has always worked fine until it hasn't. as long as the government acts in a neutral capacity to do the best thing for the economy, there is no problem. but the people who are closest to the means of production of money - kings, central bankers, cabinet members - also have the most incentive to confiscate a large share for themselves. or they could follow a monetary policy that might make them look good in the short term while throwing the system into chaos in the long run. this can be seen in the case of the fall of rome and constantinople, the hyperinflation in zimbabwe, the shift of the us and other countries away from the gold standard \\[1\\], and the inflation that is looming over the us right now.\n\nlooking at history, what would the perfect currency look like?\n\n* **convenient to handle.** it should be divisible, portable, safe to store, and easy to transact with. units should be interchangeable (fungible).\n* **credible.** the validity of the money should be guaranteed in some way, either by its intrinsic value or by some mechanism such as the backing of a counterparty (like the government).\n* **liquid.** it should be easy to find people who accept payment with it.\n* **secure.** if the money can be compromised, it cannot store wealth.\n* **inflation resistant.** it should be hard to create and resistant to control by small groups of people with vested interests.\n* **stable.** the value should not have significant volatility.\n\nthe most important requirement though is that people **adopt it** en masse. money is a collective story that people believe in, a story that lets them exchange value with each other. if an ecosystem is built around this story, it gives the money more value, further strengthening people's beliefs.\n\n**how does bitcoin do on these grounds?** let us start by understanding what bitcoin is and why it is so different from existing forms of money.\n\nbitcoin\n\nbitcoin is a **decentralized** digital **cryptocurrency** that can be used for **peer-to-peer transactions** through a **distributed ledger.** let's unpack that.\n\n* **bitcoin is decentralized.** there is no government, organization, or single authority that controls the policies of bitcoin.\n* **bitcoin is a cryptocurrency** \\- a form of digitized money whose units cannot be duplicated.\n* **bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions** \\- there is no reliance on a central banking system.\n* **bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger** \\- a copy of every transaction ever made on the bitcoin network is stored in all the nodes of the network! but because each transaction is anonymized, you can effectively check only your own transactions.\n\nbitcoin was invented in 2008 (in the throes of the housing crisis market crash) by a figure named satoshi nakamoto whose real identity is unknown. satoshi open-sourced the code to bitcoin after publishing a white paper about it, and as more people started adopting it, satoshi vanished mysteriously.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnpbdr6h8j181.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f367db0a2fd213e829b8a37284fd75e8789fc0\n\nto the layman, bitcoin is currently just like any other stock or asset that you can exchange dollars for. to use bitcoin, all that is needed is a wallet that gives the user a **public address** that others can transact with, and a **private key** that acts as a password. bitcoin can be bought at **cryptocurrency exchanges** or mined (will be explained shortly). this is then stored in software or hardware wallets, and exchanged for products or services with other users. there is no central authority over bitcoin.\n\neach bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units called satoshis for convenience.\n\nsince 2008, bitcoin has grown in leaps and bounds to become a dominant force in the market and people's imagination. but...\n\nwhere does bitcoin get its value from?\n\nwe saw earlier that if it\u2019s easy to make money, anybody can flood the market and destroy its value. this was also the reason for gold's adoption for minting coins because gold is very hard to produce (apart from being nice and shiny).\n\nthe government's ability to print massive amounts of money is the chief danger to modern forms of money. imagine you have a million dollars and it\u2019s worthless tomorrow because a bunch of people in the government thought it's alright to print another quadrillion dollars. that's the fear which drives people to invest in real estate, stocks, gold, and other commodities. **there is no alternative government-backed currency in circulation today that qualifies as \"hard money\"**, whose supply is restricted.\n\nthat's one of bitcoin's chief attractions. bitcoin is *extremely hard to produce* and *has a cap on its supply*. each block that needs to be added to the bitcoin blockchain (distributed ledger) needs to be identified by a number that satisfies a mathematical property. \\[2\\] bitcoins are produced by \"miners\" who try to find these numbers by running through millions of options in a brute-force manner. when miners hit upon a successful candidate, **they are rewarded in bitcoins**. this is a highly energy-intensive process and the profit that the miners get is in the thin margin between electricity consumption and the value of the bitcoin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1pced6gi8j181.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed333c93c9aff06f29350bd7654fb053ac15d83\n\nthe physical exchange of energy for bitcoin is similar to expending effort in mining gold. the second feature is that **there can be only 21 million bitcoins in existence**, ever. this is a hard feature of its code that cannot be changed. \\[3\\] 20 million bitcoin would be mined by 2025 (by current estimates). by 2140, all of the bitcoin would be mined, and the incentive for miners will be in the form of transaction fees. as the supply of bitcoin is finite, **it cannot be devalued by increasing the supply** making it inflation resistant by design.\n\nthere is no central authority for bitcoin. the code is open-sourced, and if anybody wants to change it, it has to be with the consensus of all the nodes in the network. for example, when some security vulnerabilities were identified in bitcoin in 2018, a fork (change in the code) was done to patch it which was accepted by all users as it was for their benefit \\[4\\]. but when **hard forks** (major changes) were done to create new currencies like bitcoin cash, the bulk of users chose to stay on the existing network, causing bitcoin cash's value to drop sharply. hence, **bitcoin's value is decided by the consensus of the network.**\n\nthe above points show that bitcoin is ***convenient, inflation resistant, secure, and credible*** (its validity is backed by a mathematical function that is impossible to break or fake).\n\nthis tells us about the **perceived value** of bitcoin, but if the aim of bitcoin is to capture the existing market, it also needs to be:\n\n1. liquid and exchangeable with existing currencies\n2. fuel for a thriving economy\n3. stable\n\nhow does bitcoin do on these fronts?\n\nliquidity\n\nlet's be real here. most people are interested in bitcoin not because of its fascinating mathematical properties or promise of inflation resistance. it's because of the **\u201cnumber go up\u201d** that every influencer is shouting about on twitter as if it\u2019s their personal achievement. that's the reason bitcoin tends to get on the nerves of some people too: **how is it that believers of an imaginary concept with no \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d behind it are rewarded time and again without any effort?**\n\nthe misconception here is that bitcoin is being compared with businesses on the stock market which grow with time because of their value proposition and execution. bitcoin is better compared with gold whose value is dictated by **scarcity.** the problem is that, unlike gold which has intrinsic value, bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on the faith that people have in **the story around it.**\n\nthe story around bitcoin is this:\n\n**\u201cbitcoin is the hardest form of money and will eventually replace all currencies.\u201d**\n\npeople who adhere to this vision are called **bitcoin maximalists.** and in terms of the stories out there, bitcoin is one of the fastest proliferating. it makes sense. when personal incentive is tied with a story, the fomo kicks in of being penniless when bitcoin takes over. the possibility of gain makes people buy into it in droves. **and as people buy into it, demand rises, and its price goes up further.**\n\n**bitcoin's strongest point is also its weakest. decentralization.**\n\nthough bitcoin claims to be \u201cdecentralized\u201d, that's only if bitcoin becomes money in itself. to convert from dollar to bitcoin, you still need **the presence of exchanges.** these exchanges are among the most loosely regulated financial entities in the world and the most vulnerable to government regulation. for example, tether, which debuted as a *stablecoin* (a cryptocurrency pegged to a commodity or government-backed currency) has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its shady accounting practices. \\[5\\] tether also turned out to be owned by the same people who owned bitfinex, a large cryptocurrency exchange. **it is one of the biggest intermediaries for bitcoin to dollar liquidity out there, and a collapse on that front due to regulations might cause a mad rush to exit.**\n\nof course, bitcoin maximalists will argue that if one exchange goes down, another will come up, and we will learn from our mistakes. but is there enough incentive to learn from our mistakes? shouldn't bitcoin be actually **useful for buying things?**\n\nthe bitcoin economy - and competitors\n\none of the biggest jokes in the history of bitcoin was when laszlo hanyecz of florida traded 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. that would be worth $574 million today, maybe the costliest meal ever. \\[6\\] but that was one of the first recorded instances of **a physical good bought with bitcoin.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjyphu8l8j181.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=b518e681fb09313178c602ee0d06d9a363a803e2\n\nsince then, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of bitcoin as a mode of payment. from retail needs to domain names, from cars to travel packages to restaurants to cellular service, the scope of bitcoin has expanded tremendously.\\[7\\] there's even a house on sale that you can buy **exclusively with bitcoin.** but there are things that you **cannot** buy with bitcoin yet. there's no direct provision to buy stocks on the nasdaq (or any other market) with cryptocurrencies, for example.\n\na big market for bitcoin is their programmability - **smart contracts will automate the market of trust.** people don't need to believe that someone else will pay them back on time and spend time in legal battles. a clause like \u201cif rains don't arrive, farmers get paid insurance\u201d can be automated to simplify the market of crop insurance. but this is also a space where bitcoin has tough competition.\n\nethereum, solana, cardano, and a handful of other cryptocurrency blockchains (with tokens called *altcoins*) sprouted to tackle problems that bitcoin couldn\u2019t. bitcoin maximalists argue that bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and anything other currencies can do, bitcoin can absorb into its code - but the facts speak otherwise. when ether started out, its trading volume was only a fraction of bitcoin\u2019s, but after ether started catering to the nft and dao space, **it's now a serious threat to bitcoin\u2019s dominance**. other cryptos assert that they do different things in a better manner compared to bitcoin. dogecoin was a mere joke till someone catapulted it to prominence. [i'm looking at you, elon.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1396698902842122244?s=20)\n\nbut one thing is for sure - it\u2019s very difficult for a new entrant to the altcoin space to gain traction and reach ***while standing for the same principles that bitcoin does.*** there is so much awareness about cryptocurrencies now that the bulk of a new altcoin offering will be bought out by a single entity. and that makes the cryptocurrency useless because its value is in its reach.\n\n**it's not money unless everyone believes it is.**\n\na strong warning is in place here: when i say a new cryptocurrency is useless, i\u2019m talking about the long term. coin offerings have a very strong possibility of being a ponzi scheme, so be very very careful with where you put your money.\n\nthere's just one more reason that bitcoin and other altcoins are still not widespread in their use.\n\nvolatility\n\nbitcoin is very volatile compared to the us dollar. this is something that even maximalists don't argue with. it is not clear whether volatility is increasing or decreasing with time and trading volume, but you can't use something as **money** if you don't know what it will be worth days, hours, even minutes from now. this is the reason bitcoin is the butt of so many jokes like this:\n\n>a 10 year old boy asks his father for a [#bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hashtag_click)\ud83d\udcf7 for his birthday. dad can i please have just one bitcoin for my birthday as a gift ? father: what ? why the hell you need $ 14,433 do you know $ 15,367 is a lot of money. what would you do with $ 12,456 dollars ?\n\nbut the assertion is that on the ***technology adoption curve***, bitcoin is still in the early majority stage, and the amount of capital that has been injected into bitcoin is minuscule compared to how much more can be injected (the figures are based on growth in market cap, number of users, and number of transactions - unreliable, because one individual can have any number of bitcoin addresses and transactions could be just buying and selling of bitcoin, not retail transactions).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mha3u2hm8j181.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc02d49dc659dd8ffe651f5945974fa046cbf7a\n\nhere we enter the realm of speculation. we must understand that bitcoin is the first of its kind - a resource that is absolutely scarce, meaning that it is the first deflationary money. some assert that the inbuilt scarcity will make volatility an inevitable feature of bitcoin, rather than a bug. \\[9\\] supporters of bitcoin assert that as we cross over from early majority to late majority in the adoption curve, bitcoin will start seeing massive adoption and this will stabilize the price (how exactly? i\u2019m not sure. i don't have enough know-how to assess this).\n\nall this talk is fine, but everybody gangsta till the big daddy of money steps in.\n\nwill the government be sleeping?\n\nbitcoin started out in anonymity and it was then laughed off as a joke. later, governments started referring to it as a highly speculative asset, and now there are murmurs that bitcoin is going to overthrow the monopoly that the government has over money. el salvador has accepted bitcoin as legal tender and announced that it would be starting the world's first \"bitcoin city\". what on earth is going on?\n\nin the standard narrative about bitcoin, after bitcoin starts gaining mass adoption there comes a phase where some central bank starts getting shifty about the hyperinflation that is rampant in the economy, and starts **buying bitcoin to hedge against the possibility of economic collapse.** other banks follow suit, doing the same, and when rumors break out, the citizens start buying up bitcoin and rapid adoption of bitcoin follows suit with bitcoin replacing the dominant currency of the country. this phase is called **hyperbitcoinization.**\n\nthat sounds great, except that the government isn't going to take this lying down. apart from the ominous angle that money is one of the chief ways that the government uses to control its citizens, there is one logical reason that the government will oppose bitcoin: **the government needs to pay its employees** and it has no means of production to produce or purchase bitcoin scalably. how will public institutions sustain themselves in the absence of cash flow? there seems to be a dreamlike scenario where the government voluntarily relinquishes power and takes a backseat as all institutions are privatized, but since satoshi vanished without leaving a manifesto on how legal institutions and the military will be funded, there seems to be a gaping hole in this grand scheme.\n\nthere is no doubt that bitcoin will play an important role in the world economy. even now, [bitcoin's market cap ranks it as 14th in the list of world economies](https://coinmarketcap.com/fiat-currencies/) (with ether at 25th). world countries switched to the gold standard when gold emerged as the hardest form of money and then switched to pegging themselves against the dollar. **it is highly likely that bitcoin (or other altcoins) will be a standard/commodity in the future.** but instead of bitcoin overthrowing governments, or governments banning bitcoin (which is very resource-intensive and difficult), it is more likely that governments will **assimilate bitcoin into their legal framework.** bitcoin might be taxed, its use cases monitored and transactions tracked. \\[10\\] though the indian and chinese governments banned bitcoin, india is now taking a softer stance by trying to tax cryptocurrency gains heavily. the lasting change might actually be in terms of **the inability of governments to manipulate the price of bitcoin.**\n\nand though hyperbitcoinization sounds cool (or ridiculous, depending on how you see it), it is not realistic or even desirable. the real meaning of this scenario sounds like a breakdown of world government (highly unlikely) \\[11\\]. hopefully, it doesn't get that far.\n\na bitcoinized world: good, bad or ugly?\n\nthe advantages of bitcoin and cryptocurrency are touted as follows:\n\n1. greater freedom of the individual\n2. resistance to inflation\n3. delegation of trust to a mathematical system\n4. reduction in government interference\n\nthe notion of decentralization has created this idea that bitcoin is going to create a symmetric world of equal opportunity. there are some counterpoints to that argument:\n\n1. the initial distribution of bitcoin is hugely skewed. by some accounts, 85% of the entire bitcoin supply is in the hands of \"whales\" who constitute just 2% of the user base (but this doesn't give them a higher edge unless the bitcoin economy develops). \\[12\\]\n2. though bitcoin promises economic opportunities for the entire world in theory, only about 60% of the world has access to the internet.\n3. bitcoiners\u2019 claim that bitcoin is the only competitive cryptocurrency out there is unproven. there is no clear data on how many people believe in bitcoin **as an asset, as money, and as a novelty.**\n4. it isn't that hard for governments to launch **a coordinated attack on cryptocurrencies** \\[13\\]. the hope is that the political neutrality of bitcoin and the personal incentive it holds gives it the edge in the long run.\n5. governments and corporations can give incentives by minting their own cryptocurrencies in certain geographical regions or internet spaces, an advantage that bitcoin cannot outcompete without violating its neutrality.\n\nso will we see bitcoin rise to ascendance in this century?\n\ncan bitcoin replace the dollar?\n\nif we consolidate all the points we have seen so far, we can see that bitcoin is a convenient, portable form of money that gives a lot of freedom to the individual. it has gone from 0 to $56,000 (as of today), crossing a market cap of $1 trillion in **a mere 13 years (apple computers took 38 years to hit the same milestone - with a solid business and advertising team backing it).** since bitcoin is a form of money that is native to the internet, the rate at which its story propagates is also phenomenal.\n\nbitcoin\u2019s true decentralization and first-mover advantage also give it a great advantage over other cryptocurrencies. though there is tough competition, some of bitcoin\u2019s core principles like the lack of a central authority give it a real edge (e.g meta tried to start its own currency libra/diem, and it faced regulatory action instantly. ethereum isn\u2019t truly decentralized either).\n\nthe real challenges for bitcoin are **price stability,** **exclusive use cases,** and **government regulation.** people will only consider bitcoin money when they are willing to part with it for *something they cannot get* with conventional money. till then, it\u2019s an asset at most. although smart contracts and a few niche use cases like nfts seem to satisfy this, only time will tell if they have a lasting impact.\n\nprice stability is also more likely when bitcoin has a strong native economy. there are different assertions about its stability - that high-frequency trading is needed to stabilise it, that creation of value will stabilise price, that in spite of boom and bust the new low is always higher than before, that price will stabilise when the number of users keeps growing, and that its price cannot be stabilised as it is an asset. the truth is that nobody has been right at forecasting either its growth or stability reliably and it\u2019s extremely difficult to do so because **we haven\u2019t seen anything like this before.**\n\ngovernment regulation is the biggest factor. without all countries of the world having a uniform stance towards bitcoin, it might just create arbitrage between different countries, not being the \u201cglobal currency\u201d that it claims to be. some milestones to watch out for would be:\n\n* the first central bank to store bitcoin as reserve currency.\n* clear legislation or regulatory action that is favorable to bitcoin.\n* stock exchanges trading bitcoin as a commodity on par with gold and oil.\n\nif any of the above happens, it heralds wider acceptance and greater stability. but with government regulation, there is **a greater probability that bitcoin will coexist with world currencies rather than overthrow them.**\n\nconclusion\n\nthough the american dollar is ubiquitous today and the central pillar of the global economy, it wasn't always so. the first american dollars were minted in 1792. but it was only in the aftermath of world war 2 in 1944 that the dollar became the standard for other global currencies - 152 years after its inception!\n\non the contrary, bitcoin has already become a force to reckon with in just 13 years. it's questionable whether the \u201cmarket cap\u201d of bitcoin represents any \u201creal\u201d economic growth, but as more people believe in it, there is more incentive to build an economy around it.\n\nbitcoin is unlikely to replace the dollar anytime soon, but the coexistence of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with world currencies is highly likely and something to watch out for. \\[14\\]\n\nif you liked

mastercard and 540% to be on par with visa in terms of volume. while that doesn't sound like much, it is a lot.\n\nthere are 3 factors that could get bitcoin to such levels:\n\n1. the number of transactions rises.\n2. the average amount of bitcoin sent per transaction rises.\n3. the bitcoin price rises.\n\nfactor #1 is likely to be (part of) the answer, but is technically complex to determine due to the privacy provided by scalability solutions such as the lightning network. i go more in-depth on this in [the full article](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/bitcoin-volume-mastercard-visa).\n\nas for factor #2 & 3: there is an unsurprising inverse correlation between the bitcoin price and the average btc sent per transaction. this means that as the bitcoin price goes up, the average btc that is transferred goes down.\n\n[data sourced from

settlement layer, while payments increasingly move to solutions built on top of it such as the lightning network, then we could see this trend reverse.\n\nuntil such a time, the bitcoin price would need to rise substantially more than 260% for the processed volume to be at mastercard level. however, taking this inverse correlation into account would complicate the model and still not account for many other potential factors such as increased inflation, new technological breakthroughs, corporate or sovereign adoption, etc.\n\nif we just take the 260% as an indicator however, and plot out 3 basic growth trends (that have no guarantee by any means to continue in their path of course), then you arrive at a time range of 2026-2060s for the bitcoin network to process an equivalent to that of the mastercard network. if the price were to grow at the minimum price increase per year rate, it would stay on par with the mastercard network.\n\n[bitcoin data sourced from

reasons:\n\n1. supply side: the bitcoin supply will only ever inflate 10% for the rest it's life, meaning the halvenings will no longer cause a severe supply shock like it once did.  for all practical purposes, we can forget about supply from miners and get in the mindset that bitcoin has already hit its supply limit of 21m coins.\n2. demand side: the % growth of users going from a few dozen users to hundreds of millions of users was massive. that was the main reason for the bitcoin price's rise in the first 5 years. there are only 8 billion people on earth, so the % growth of users will decline as we hit the ceiling of the law of large numbers.\n\ndemand coming from brand new users will experience diminishing returns (as mentioned in #1)...but the price overall will **not** experience diminishing returns. why? because the currency we are denominating bitcoin in is always depreciating at an exponential rate. that's why the housing market, stocks, and gold have never

that bitcoin stays at around $60k and that the network hash rate stays at 160 eh. several of the mining companies have recently raised very significant amounts of money, and stated that they want to raise their share of mining rewards next year. it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that the network hash rate will rise significantly, so the $15,000 rig may never break even. what\u2019s surprising is that said rig costs only $1700 to manufacture, and that includes all overheads and amortised design costs.\n\nlots of people would like to mine bitcoin, but they soon find out that efficient mining rigs are way out of their price range; how many regular folks can readily access $1000 let alone $12,000? we want to open up profitable mining to everyone, even if they can only afford $100 \u2013 **and that\u2019s a one off payment**. it won\u2019t buy them their own mining rig but our project will generate *continuous* income for them, pretty much regardless of bitcoin\u2019s value, the network hashing rate or the reward halving in may 2024. they won\u2019t have to worry about electricity costs, rig efficiency, burnt out hashing boards, new technologies and importantly, privacy - we don\u2019t need or want to know who our investors are or what taxes they pay in their jurisdictions.\n\n**what\u2019s** ***really*** **important here is that the little guys can for once compete on a level playing field with the mining companies and rig manufacturers.**\n\nthe project needs funding of $65 million to enable:\n\n\\- an initial hashing power of just over 4.2 eh using 10 nm (intel) or 7 nm (tsmc) technology\n\n\\- construction of a suitably secured, level paved site in iceland and /or norway of around 10 acres (4 hectares)\n\n\\- a direct grid connection initially with 2 x 120 mva power transformers and associated switchgear\n\n\\- construction of  modified shipping containers to hold hashing modules and immersion cooling equipment\n\n40% of net revenues go to building more equipment, 40% goes to the initial funders, 10% for local taxation and 10% goes to the company for profit and r & d, this enables income to more than keep up with increases in the network hashing rate. our hashing containers will each hold 0.536 eh of mining power. when fully equipped with their individual distribution transformers and switch gear they will cost approximately $5.5 million each.\n\nif successfully funded it will take around 14 months to get the electronic/power infrastructures built, tested and commissioned. the initial hashing power per $100 invested equates to 6.6 th, but will increase by more than 10 times that by the end of 2023, by which time the **monthly** income per $100 will be approximately $120. yes, you read it correctly. income will be paid monthly and will start to flow around month 16; by month 24 an initial $100 invested will have been paid back and generated at least an extra $600 in income ($90,000 if $15,000 was put in), and because of the uniqueness of our concept the income will keep coming month after month.\n\n**this is not a get rich quick scheme.**\n\nlike any other investment this project carries an element of risk, so never gamble what you can\u2019t afford to lose. does the howey test classify this project as a security? yes it does, but the company won\u2019t be based in the usa or singapore and we will only be able to identify investors by their wallet address, nothing else.\n\nwe hope to have our website up and running by the first week in december. meantime, if you have any sensible questions please use the forums so that everyone can see the replies.\n\n**we are not asking for any investment at this point in time.**", {"entities": [[0, 7, "crypto"], [699, 706, "crypto"], [1219, 1226, "crypto"], [1624,

best to live up to that reputation. his subsequent introduction to his latest book had a powerpoint presentation with a slide picturing an el salvadoran volcano.  this was unrelated to bitcoin, but mentioned in the context of past volcanic eruptions affecting the degree of solar radiation penetrating earth's troposphere (a subject of his latest book).\n\nanother good question asked later was about neal's technical writing process, to which he answered that he begins writing with pen on paper, making edits when they occur to him.  neal said he finds this faster than computer interfaces and

announcement. \n\nmy hometown is in a close city from the place where bitcoin city is going to be built, which is called la union, and my father works exactly there. i currently live in the capital city san salvador and had to move here six years ago due to work.   \n\n\n**the concentration of development in san salvador, the rest of the country in oblivion**\n\nwell, you'll see, el salvador is a very small country in territory but all the development is concentrated only and **only** in the capital city san salvador and all the rest of the country has been abandoned basically since the country's foundation. that is one reason for my anger towards the old politicians and previous generations who did merely **nothing** to distribute richness and development equally along in the country and they forgot completely about all the other cities. as a result, logically all the young people has been migrating year after year to san salvador, including me, who had to say good bye to our families and hometowns in order to get a better job to survive. and the thing is that those previous politicians forgot about the countryside and all the rest of the country due to corruption issues and lack of vision and lack of perspective. they weren't that smart, they weren't that savvy about the modern world, and this is an issue that still persists in our neighbor countries like guatemala and honduras. \n\n  \nso for us, having development in an area that is not the capital city is a big, or a huge improvement. as i said when i started, this country is really small in territory, you can cross it entirely in just six ours! and it would be even less if our transportation system gets improved. in my hometown we have cultural differences in holidays, food, traditions, and beliefs, this is a very rich country when it's about culture, in fact, among the citizens, it feels like we have two countries inside: the west and the east. in the west we have san miguel (my homecity) and la union, which is known for being close to the sea. la union is known for being really hot, tropical place, you have warm wind during summer and is perfect for going to the beach, which is like 15 minutes far. \n\n&#x200b;\n\n**we live in a bubble.**\n\nwhen it's about the contact with foreigners, it is very uncommon thing for the average salvadorian. salvadorans usually see foreign people like people who do not like to visit us because we think ourselves that our country is so bad that no one wants to visit, and even less to live here. and many times we tend to question visitors about why they visit us if they could be \"better\" in their countries. it has happened many times. i've met people from all around the globe here, from china, taiwan, japan, germany, france, colombia, the us, russia, egypt, mexico, sweden, etc. some of them have years living here that they got to become residents and all of them have told me that at some point they get asked \"what are you doing here?\" meaning \"you could get back to live better in sweden (or any country where you lived before)\", but they also tell me that salvadorans are highly friendly with them, gain confidence and trust really fast, they are warm and welcoming and overall very human. salvadorans help you if you're in problem, even if they don't know who you are, they talk to you and try to make friends very fast, so once you get into their circle they'll teach you everything you need to know.\n\nbut there is something else that i want to mention. this is nothing new in the world tho, we also have it. many foreigners here in el salvador live in separated areas, it is not seen like that but yeah, in fact, there are residential building where no regular salvadorans have access (just th eeople who work in cleaning and maintenance stuff). those foreigners may have another version of el salvador, another very different where they don't get much contact with locals, and have no touch of how is our culture and our average day to day reality. these residential areas have been accommodated to provide all their needs and there is no need for them to go out. in the present days still more of there residential areas are being built, there is even one huge building in  la escalon, in sal salvador, which is an area known for being built for rich people to live in. but in the recent years this rich people have been moving to another area called santa elena, and the la escalon is being left for regular people little by little. if bitcoin city is going to be like this, it's ok i think, because we already have areas like that, but as a salvadoran, my wish is to have development in the whole country and not only for a little bunch of people like it was in the past. and we already know about that. fortunately we've seen it's not going to be the case.   \n\n\n**gangs. buses and transport.** \n\nthere used to be gangs at my city when i lived there. i was robbed in a bus six times, they robbed me my phone and money. and around my house around two people a year used to be murdered. i saw death people and blood. as a local, they do nothing to you because they know you. gangsters are the same people who used to be our friends in school, but one day they joined the gang because they had no money, no job, no opportunities and weren't able to leave the country (remember when i told you in the beginning that the whole country was forgotten with no development and nothing else than misery). they manage to survive, unfortunately in the wrong way. i remember the day i decided i ws going to fight for my life, but not in that way! i decided to never enter a gang, i decided that i was going to be different. so how have we reduced gang activity in the last two years? 1. the government is giving opportunities to young people (i myself was in a help program, learning how to put my own business). 2. the government cut the economic help that previous corrupt governments gave to them. 3. the police force was heavily increased and supported them with new equipment and improved salaries \n\nalso, young people now have different facilities where they can learn about technology, or another areas like making food, learn languages, and leverage other skills. nowadays there are no murders in my home city and fortunately we don't have to think much about that. \n\nabout transportation, it has been a huge, huge issue all our life. basically the owners of the transportation system are also a corrupt group who have the monopoly of transportation and have a horrible transportation system. that is the reason why the best way to go to another side of the city is to have a car. the current government has announced to be working in extreme measures to eradicate this problem. the main transport medium for the average salvadoran is bus and if you live here and go downtown on a monday at 5pm you'll be able to see the busses extremely filled with people like sardines in a can (which reminds me the japanese metro system that also is like that). so, historically, these buses have been the areas where many murders and assaults have occurred, due to its importance for the work of people and its importance for the whole country, the gangs have taken them several times in our history, perpetrating once one of the worst terrorist attacks of our country, when they burned a whole bus full of people. in our collective history, it is in the mind of every salvadoran and that is the reason why every salvadoran has a deep fear of our transportation system even tho we have to use it every day if we want to go to work or move around the city. we just learned to live with that fear, i am not rich, and i am young, my current job barely gives me food for the month and i can't afford a car. we have a big hope in the current government, which has proven that they listen to the citizens concerns and most important needs and that is the reason for their success, that is the reason why left them approve the bitcoin law, because even we didn't know what bitcoin was, they have done a work that is so good that we trusted them blindly when they announced it, we just thought \"they have done a good job until now, this bitcoin thing must be something good also\". some few detractors that are here and there don't understand none of this, and they think that is because nayib wears a cap and says nice things, but actually, we, the average people have been able to see the results of their work as a team, not just nayib but all the people who works in these projects. those detractors, a fewer number of them have so much money that they pay people to spread fake news all over the world and over the web. they used to pay politicians and powerful people to do whatever they wanted, but with nayib on the head they aren't able to do that. that's why they are angry. and soem people who are detractors and tell you about recent murdering stories, if you ask them how they know about it you realize that it is the story of a friend of a friend of a friend who saw something in instagram of facebook. yes, still there are murders, but not in our face, people now go out and enjoy the day, they fill the parks with their families and friends, even these friends who told me these recent murder stories, they go camping. \n\n&#x200b;\n\n**we need talent.** \n\nwe have so many good programmers that work for companies overseas, one of my closest friends is one of them. we have many people who can speak english like me, and other languages (i learned japanese in order to get a job), because of that need to survive we learned all of there things because we became **experts** in telecommunications and remote work even before the pandemic, with call centers. that is the reason why many of the call center services in the world are located here. i live some minutes to one of these places, they have thousands of people working here in that type of job and almost all of the roommates who i have lived with speak english everyday in their jobs and some of them also french. but due to the reason that all the development is in the capital city, all of us have moved here! even young people in the most distant towns learn english with the only hope that it will take them out of poverty. call center is offered here as the only alternative to have a job. and it is better paid than doctors or engineers. but it has a vary dark side. it is just labor exploitation. the bosses make them work in insane non human timeframe schedules with no chance to go to the bathroom or eat in many cases. sometimes they have lunch but it is a very short timeframe and they have so many over-stress problems to the point where almost all of their workers have stomach problems and mental health issues. it is common in those buildings to have stories about workers who committed suicide or just died from heart attacks and the company doesn't care about them. i was trapped in one of these places and thanks to them i improved my english but thanks to internet jobs, nft gaming and crypto earnings me and some of my friends were able to leave that f\\*\\*\\*g slavery behind. \n\n&#x200b;\n\ni still think we need more talent. it is yet not enough to compete with the us or japan, much or our own talent moved to these countries in the previous decades and it is understandable because we were living in hell over here. but now our challenge is to bring talent over here and improve more and more the living conditions for them. we still have a lot of beautiful nature, short travel times (the country itself is small), rich culture, delicious food, friendly people! but the government has been working in lowering those crime rates, building a lot of bridges, improving infrastructure like freeways, streets, the water system, transportation, building a new airport and improving the one we already have, building new hospitals and they have a huge new school system plan, they made a new new born program for all the new babies that come to life here to come in better conditions and the president and his team themselves were in 2019 overseas looking for opportunities telling investors and other governments that we exist. bitcoin was just one of these things at that time, that we had no idea was going to put us in the eye of people (as good or bad). there is so much that we want to do and to little people, that we do what we can at a time.   \n\n\nso, the bitcoin city is going to be built in the middle of all of this. and our hopes are on it. a city takes several years to be built but we are working in order to make it a true reality.   \nthanks for the people who have read until here. the topic is still related to bitcoin as

ended up\n\nby martha muir\n\n\nchina\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency mining in may triggered an exodus of miners and a global race to relocate millions of the clunky, power intensive machines they use to solve complex puzzles and earn bitcoin.\n\nfourteen of the biggest crypto mining companies in the world have moved more than 2m machines out of china in the months following the ban, according to data gathered by the financial times. the lion\u2019s share of machines was hastily moved to the us, canada, kazakhstan and russia.\n\nbit digital, one of the largest us-listed crypto mining companies, hired an international logistics firm to extract its property from china and is still waiting for a batch of almost 1,000 machines to be released from the docks at the port of new york.\n\n\u201cwe started our fleet migration in march 2020, which in hindsight was a great move. when the ban was announced we had 20,000 miners in china,\u201d said sam tabar, chief strategy officer of bit digital. still, the company said it had to abandon 372 machines in china, which had \u201creached the end of their useful lives\u201d.\n\neight out of the 10 largest public mega farms based in north america have expanded the number of machines in their fleets since china\u2019s ban, the ft\u2019s figures show.\n\n\nwhen the ban hit, toronto crypto mining company hut8 was bombarded with offers from panicked chinese sellers, said sue ennis, the company\u2019s vp of corporate development and investor relations. \u201cwe were getting calls from providers which were pretty opaque and one-sided,\u201d she said. \u201cthey would ask us to pay $20m with no recourse if it does not arrive or arrives broken.\u201d the company ended up adding 24,000 machines in june, from chinese company microbt.\n\nthe \u201cfrenzied liquidations\u201d triggered by china\u2019s ban caused the price of an antminer s19, a popular model among industrial miners, to fall by 41.7 per cent from may to july, analysis by mining company luxor mining showed.\n\nrecommended\nbitcoin\nus overtakes china as biggest bitcoin mining hub after beijing ban\nchinese crypto mining machine manufacturer bitmain, the maker of the s19, had sold 30,000 machines to marathon digital holdings, a mining company based in las vegas, in august; while maryland based terawulf bought another 30,000. the company announced in june that it was suspending sales of its machines to \u201chelp the industry transition smoothly\u201d and reduce the \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on the market.\n\noutside the us, kazakhstan has become a leading mining centre. ft data show the bulk of the machines going to kazahstan came from chinese mining company bitfufu, which shipped 80,000 machines to farms in kazakhstan, and bit mining, which shipped 7,849 machines by august.\n\nanother beneficiary of china\u2019s ban was russia. in the weeks following china\u2019s ban, moscow-based infrastructure hosting company bit cluster received over 5,000 machines from china, while russian crypto mining company bitriver said it is hosting 200,000 machines from exiled chinese miners, which are being shipped in batches.\n\n\u201cthe focus of the market has shifted from a lack of equipment to a lack of space for its placement,\u201d said roman zabuga, a spokesperson for bitriver. a couple of weeks before the ban, the company had to turn down a deal with a chinese client looking to offload another million machines, he said.\n\naccording to jaran mellerud, a research analyst at arcane crypto, just under 700,000 chinese machines have not been turned back on after the ban and are likely to be sitting in storage. since many of these are older generation machines, like the antminer s9, it is less cost effective to ship them to locations such as the united states. in july, the price of an s9 dipped to just $367.\n\n\ncrypto mining companies are facing competition from local people building their own rigs \u00a9 andrey rudakov/bloomberg\nthis has led to older generation machines being scattered to less established mining locations such as venezuela or paraguay, where there is less regulatory stability but cheap electricity prices.\n\njuan jose pinto, co-founder of doctor miner, a mining company in caracas, said the chinese ban \u201cis a great opportunity\u201d. \u201cwe\u2019ve been contacted by three different big chinese miners so far to host around 7,000 machines,\u201d he said. \u201cif we had the resources we could host a lot more.\u201d\n\npinto said his company pays around $0.01 per kwh for electricity, meaning that it can effectively use older, more power hungry machinery like antminer s9s. although these machines are rickety and more prone to breakdowns, pinto and his team have found imaginative ways to keep them in operation.\n\n\u201cwe have what we call \u2018the cemetery\u2019, where we put miners that aren\u2019t working, but have parts which are,\u201d said pinto. \u201cif i have one machine with four broken parts and another machine with six broken parts, i unite them and hopefully build one good miner.\u201d\u00a0\n\ndigital assets, a company based in asunci\u00f3n, is preparing to host 15,500 miners in the coming months but faces competition from some paraguayan locals who have started to buy machines and mine independently.\n\nand owing to venezuela\u2019s battered economy, mining cryptocurrency is a way for locals to top up their earnings. \u201cpeople mine in their houses with just one machine,\u201d said pinto. \u201cin other countries, there are a few big guys with farms, here there are thousands of people with small farms. making $100 extra per month makes a huge difference for them.\u201d\n\n\nsource,

just to double the block size from 1mb to 2mb? also isn't it that what miners and nodes need are just some more storage space? why this amount of increase would affect?\n2. increasing the block size would be just a temporary solution. as more people using bitcoin, the block size would never be enough, and we would eventually need other solutions like layer 2 or sidechain, and why not just use them? but why that some protocols can simply increase the block size and have not run into scalability issue without segwit or sidechain or layer 2. or is it just because their scales are not large enough?\n3. hard fork is too hard for bitcoin as there were already so many nodes and miners running the program. i think this might be a reasonable reason? since the developers would also want to

capital markets charge high interest.  they are now going to bitfinex with ridiculously low interest.  you should not buy these bonds unless the interest is significantly better\n\nas you may have heard, nayib bukele is selling bitcoin bonds to build a bitcoin city. these bonds will be 5 year bonds, trading at 6.5%. put bluntly, that level of interest on salvadoran bonds, even in bitcoin, is ridiculously low.\n\nlet me explain. if you look at regular salvadoran bonds, you will see that the interest rate on their 20 year bonds due 2023 is 7.75%, and on their 10 year bonds due 2029 is 8.625%. you may think that is an acceptable bitcoin discount. however, this is not the correct number to use-we need to use yield.\n\nyield is, basically, the interest rate scaled to the bond\u2019s current price. this makes sense, because if you buy a $1000 bond paying 4% for 500 its really paying you 8%. so lets look at el salvador\u2019s yields. the first one, due 2023, has a yield of a [whopping 26.5%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012aj55-el-salvador-republik-7-75-02-23). the second one, due 2029, has a yield of a [still-high 15%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012bx31-el-salvador-republik-8-625-17-29). if these bonds would be due in 2027, you could reasonably expect a yield between those two figures (a linear approximation would expect 19%, but linear approximations are not very useful in bond trading).\n\nnow, you could tell me that its worth buying a bitcoin bond at full price for 6.5% interest, or even at a premium-if bitcoin goes up, you win, after all. not so fast-this runs into what\u2019s called currency risk. if the price of bitcoin doubles, and el salvador has spent the bitcoin it gained from the bonds on construction of bitcoin city, then el salvador will have to come up with more value to pay you back than they recieved. this happens in countries where there is little faith in the home currency-when mexican companies issued dollar denominated bonds and the peso crashed, there were significant concerns about ability to pay. same thing applies here.\n\nbitcoin bonds are a cool idea, and a novel one. however, they should not be sold at 1/3 of the yield as a dollar-denominated bond. bukele is trying to take advantage of bitcoiners to raise capital cheaply-be cautious. i would advise against buying these bonds at anything below a 10% yield.\n\nedit 1: people have informed me that this bond is likely dollar denominated.  in that case, it should certainly get a yield in between the 15% and 26.5% figures, and you as an investor should, if you want a salvadoran bond, pick either of those over this offering.  this is because theyd be in the same currency and from the

has to have in order to become a currency?\n\n1.- divisibility: money needs to be divisible, it's a pretty obvious one, if you wan't to buy something expensive you won be carrying 2 trucks full of coins with you, you can just make bigger measures of money or smaller ones for cheap things like a can of soda.\n\n2.- durability: it needs to be stand the proof of time, and i'm not talking about the agreement on a certain fiat currency such as usd or eur, i mean, if you store 5 apples in a bank they're going to be worth nothing in a few days (if you use apples for exchanging goods), but if you put coins, paper, or gold it will be there for a long, long time.\n\n3.- recognizability: each trading party can verify the authenticity of the money. meaning that every transaction that i'm giving you money, you can be secure if it is real, by putting in into that light that reflects certain materials that they put into money, if it would be gold there are other ways to verify if it's real.\n\n4.- portability: pretty obvious one, you must be able to move it across time and space without problem.\n\n5.- scarcity: this is the most important thing about money, and one of the best ways that crypto it's better than fiat money ruled by goverments. scarcity occurs when the demand outstrips supply, so when there is a demand of a certain currency there will be a supply of that currency.\n\ncrypto, just makes the checkmark over these 5 services, and specially scarcity. why? governments and the people who control the flow of currencies, **always** takes advantage of the position where they are in, and just print more of that currency in order to have more for them, and less for everybody else, this is just human nature, and you can study a little bit of history and you will notice that this repeats over time on every society.\n\nin the case of bitcoin, we just have supply of 21,000,000 coins, and no one can make more out of tin air like governments do, when they please. so scarcity, it's the main advantage that crypto and bitcoin has over fiat currencies.\n\nso if you ask me, for the reasons that i just gave, hillary clinton, just point out the fact that

week. i've summarized the articles but also provided sources below in case you're interested in reading the full articles.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**bitrefill expands its scope of services in salvadore**: bitrefill, a company that sells bitcoin-funded prepaid cards for various services globally, has introduced a new bill payment service that enables salvadorans to use bitcoin to pay for a variety of essential requirements. bitcoin has been legal tender in el salvador since september 7. still, many establishments are yet to use it as a payment mechanism. hence, salvadorians can use bitcoin to pay for 150 various services, including internet, water, insurance, loans, taxes, mortgage, social security, and university expenditures. bitrefill\u2019s mission is to provide companies with a solution to effortlessly transition to bitcoin and alleviate their present concerns.\n\n**fidelity will launch canada\u2019s first bitcoin custodian**: on wednesday, canada\u2019s investment industry regulatory organization granted fidelity clearing canada a license to start a bitcoin trading and custody platform. it is targeted at institutional investors, including pension funds, portfolio managers, and mutual funds. it would be the country\u2019s first of its sort. additionally, the business intends to appeal to regular investors via its recently published regulatory registration for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and mutual fund. fidelity has about $4.2 trillion in assets under management globally as of september. additionally, exchange-traded cryptocurrency products are gaining popularity, with over 40 pending approval in the united states alone.\n\n**primeblock plans $1.5b spac merger to become public**: prime blockchain, also known as primeblock bitcoin mining enterprise, is considering combining with special purpose acquisition company 10x capital venture acquisition corp ii to go public in the united states. the spac wants to raise more than $150 million via a so-called private investment in public equity, or pipe, to finance the acquisition, bringing primeblock public and valuing the amalgamated corporation at roughly $1.5 billion. following the news, shares of 10x capital venture surged 11 percent in early pre-market trading in new york on thursday, november 18.\n\n**bitcoin went through a major upgrade since last four years**: bitcoin has completed the most significant network update in the last four years. the improvement, dubbed taproot, is intended to simplify transaction processing and make it more effective in speed and cost. taproot upgrades several signatures and transactions at the same time. on the bitcoin network, digital signatures are needed to validate transactions. they are produced and verified against public keys using private keys. before the installation of taproot, transaction verification on the bitcoin network was sluggish because each digital signature was confirmed against a public key. this strategy increased the time necessary to complete complicated multi-signature transactions requiring several inputs and signatures.\n\n**bitcoin miner marathon digital plans fundraising for bitcoin acquisition**: marathon digital holdings, a publicly listed bitcoin miner with a market capitalization of $5.5 billion, is launching a $650 million senior convertible note issuance due in 2026. due to high demand, the offering was rapidly raised from $500 million to $1 billion. marathon plans to utilize the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate objectives, which may include the purchase of bitcoin or bitcoin mining equipment, the business said. the notes bear an annual interest rate of 1% and provide an opportunity to raise an additional $97 million from authorized investors. due to their bitcoin holdings, this offering may be more akin to a collateralized loan from the stock market, which would explain the demand for it and the comparatively low interest rate since the market seems to believe it is a pretty safe investment.\n\n**bitcoin mining raises power concerns in the us**: texas, already home to the us\u2019s most fragile power infrastructure, is set to see a spike in electrical demand twice the size of austin. following china\u2019s may ban on bitcoin mining, the us became the world\u2019s largest bitcoin mining center, particularly in places like texas. however, what was first seen as a tremendous opportunity for the city seems to be devolving into a problem. texas is highly popular among cryptocurrency miners due to its business-friendly policies and low power costs. the bulk of large crypto mining cooperatives are expanding their current capacity with additional mining rigs. this has raised serious concerns about the electric grid\u2019s ability to sustain the tremendous strain.\n\n**us city gets a bitcoin atm at airport**: williston, north dakota, announced a partnership with cryptocurrency atm provider coin cloud on wednesday to deploy cryptocurrency atms at its international airport. moreover, williston also accepts cryptocurrency for utility bill payments. the city underlined that it does not operate as the fund\u2019s custodian or oversee any cryptocurrency transactions, underlining that coin cloud handles all purchases and withdrawals. the official stated that the city of williston\u2019s next move would be to install a crypto atm in city hall in response to increased demand at the airport. \u201cas part of our strategy, we want to ultimately extend these payment pathways to licenses, permits, and other local payments,\u201d he said.\n\n**china warns state-owned companies to cease bitcoin operations**: china\u2019s state-owned firms have been warned to halt cryptocurrency mining. additionally, china warned that it would hike power bills for businesses that continued to disregard the rule. china\u2019s government declared all cryptocurrency trading illegal some months ago. following that, cryptocurrency miners and exchanges such as huobi and binance started relocating to nations with crypto-friendly policies. additionally, beijing officials have begun monitoring residents\u2019 ip addresses to detect crypto mining activity. additionally, officials in zhejiang province are investigating government personnel suspected of unlawful bitcoin

price goods in bitcoin, the concept of it being an alternative currency goes out of the window. whoever heard of a currency that can\u2019t perform as a currency?!\n\n4. it\u2019s too deflationary: ultimately there can only be 21 quadrillion satoshis available (if i\u2019ve done my maths correctly!), which means if bitcoin gets to a certain price point, people may not be able to use bitcoin

payments also might unlock new business models, similar to how the rise of card payments enabled the growth of online shopping.\n\n### at a glance: accepting bitcoin vs. credit cards\n\ncryptocurrency: a cryptocurrency payment tool provides a user interface that makes transacting in crypto easier for the merchant and the customer. these tools can also help ease issues related to price fluctuation and often provide a built-in way to convert crypto to dollars. crypto transactions aren\u2019t required to be routed through payment tools \u2014 instead, they are a value-add service.\n\ncredit cards: a credit card processor communicates with card networks and banks to verify customer identities, confirm that customers have sufficient funds or credit and initiate the movement of money from the acquiring bank to the merchant\u2019s account. it\u2019s impossible to accept a card payment without a payment processor.\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**fees:**\n\ncrypto:  0% if done directly with customer. can be 1% or so using a payment tool. \n\ncredit cards:  standard flat rate is 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction, but varies by processor. \n\n **safety and security :**\n\ncrypto:  little to no responsibility for compliance or fraud. \n\ncredit cards:  responsibility for compliance and (via fees) for fraud. \n\n**resolving customer issues :**\n\ncrypto:  no legal protections or chargebacks to manage, but you'll likely need to make clear your own policies. \n\ncredit cards:  decisions often in the hands of card networks, and they often favor the customer. \n\n**bottom line: you don\u2019t need a payment service to accept crypto like you do with card payments, fees are cheaper with crypto, no fraud protection and no legal protection when you accept crypto.** the only negative point for crypto is the volatility.  \n\n*but then, on the other hand, you are protected against high inflation.*", {"entities": [[10, 17, "crypto"], [133, 140, "crypto"],

are paying at\u00a0crypto.com. not saying i'm quite there, but it could put a decent dent in my expenses. however i don't think i'm going to do it, and here is why.\n\n\nthe only way crypto.com can generate that big apy is by investing in other assets, lending it out again to others at higher apy, or trading it. none of these are guaranteed to be net profitable in any given year. in fact it can be quite the opposite in a bad year, some principal can be lost. statistically, over the long run, there seems to be an increasing probability of losses to principal deposits. think of every year as a game of russian roulette.\n\n\nso does a company like crypto.com pass on those losses to depositors like you? perhaps you deposited 5 btc and maybe they could reduce your balance to 4 btc after a particularly rough year. unacceptable! so what if they promise not to do that no matter how bad things are going with their investments? let's say there's a big bear market, or they just made the wrong trades, or lent it out to the wrong people who day traded it away. so total deposits were 10000 btc, but they only have assets worth 8000 btc now. let's say their terms and conditions don't allow them to reduce anyone's btc balance. then they are running a fractional reserve, and if there's ever a run on the bank, which can happen during a bear market, there will be a few bag holders at the end who only have a receipt from a bankrupt company. quadrigacx is a prime example of this, or bernie madoff. both seemed legit for a long time.\n\n\nbut crypto.com has got their name on a sports arena. so come on this must be safe right? i don't know how many of you remember enron. they had their name on a sports arena also, but one year later they went bankrupt. in fact there is something called the arena naming curse.\n\n\ni guess i'm just wondering statistically how a company can guarantee your principal and simultaneously guarantee a very high apy, with supposedly no risk of loss to your principal? statistically this seems impossible. it feels an awful lot like bernie madoff's wonderful fund which paid reliably for many years, until suddenly everything was gone. what is a ponzi anyway but a fractional reserve on steroids?\n\n\nso i guess for now i'm not earning anything on my core bitcoin holdings except capital appreciation and storage of value, but i do own my keys. i remain somewhat tempted however.\n\n\np.s. on a related note while i am 90% in bitcoin, i am approximately 10% in other projects, and i will admit i am earning some interest on those, but only on their native lending platforms. my reasoning there is if those native platforms go bust, the native tokens are liable also to go bust, which means you're screwed even if you owned your keys, so i might as well earn on them, on their own lending platforms. but if the chickens ever come home to roost with all this bitcoin lending, i guess i feel it prudent to keep at least the core holdings that are in bitcoin secure, at the cost of some sweet looking apy.\n\nedit:\nthank you all for your comments below i really appreciate the discussion. i pretty much stayed out of the discussion below

consideration that this way of thinking might only makes sense before satoshi. \n\nwhat if, after satoshi, politics changed, permanently?\n\nbefore satoshi, reliably owning _anything_, of any kind, in a way that it couldn't be taken from you, required violence. because violence is expensive and risky, ownership evolved to relying on courts and an entire hierarchical system for resolving disputes. if that hierarchy broke down, there would be violence. but the base layer of the stack was always violence. \n\nyou might see these dispute resolution mechanisms as being [a distributed consensus mechanism](https://apxhard.com/2021/05/09/distributed-consensus-algorithms-in-the-animal-kingdom/). in other words,  \"proof of work + longest chain\" should be seen as an alternative to things like courts and armies. \n\nduring the english revolution, some people  proposed giving everyone the right to vote. but the intellectuals agreed this didn\u2019t work - they wanted a \u2018proof of stake\u2019 model where only landowners (i.e. stakeholders) could vote.  this time period - in the 1500\u2019s - also saw a nascent communist sect (the diggers) as well as the origin of ideas like freedom of religion. we\u2019ve been having the same \u2018before satoshi\u2019 arguments for hundreds of years.  \n\n bitcoin is, indeed, something new under the sun.  \n\nafter satoshi, yes, you _can_ own property without needing violence or courts. \n\nafter satoshi you can send that property long distance, without needing roads that are maintained by states and protected with violence and the threat thereof.  the lightning network is the first way to send value, anywhere in the world, more or less instantaneously, more or less free, without relying on a _single specific_ hierarchy that uses violence to enforce claims on property.\n\nyes, virginia, there is one hierarchy today.  the dominant hierarchy that exists today has no name; 'bretton woods' or davos might be as close as we get.  this hierarchy is made up of nation states, of courts, of militaries and banks and ngo's and people meeting in davos to buy $30 hotdogs in 2016, before they exported their inflation to the rest of us.  this hierarchy is also made up of drug cartels, mafia states, and terrorist millionaires like osama bin laden.   the hierarchy consists of the chinese communist party, the democrats, the republicans, corporate media, big technology, and every other existing corporation that has a stake in keeping the current game going.\n\nthis hierarchy has used 'before satoshi' politics to keep itself intact. \n\nthe costs this hierarchy has imposed on us are nameless and uncountable. debt, misery, violence, fear, genocide. widespread anxiety stress and panic as we realize the world is far beyond our control.  neighbors fighting neighbors. babies having babies. these are the costs inherent in 'before satoshi' politics, a layer of violence concealed by a layer of kabuki theatre.  the cheap seats are miserable; if you can pay the cost, the expensive seats reward you for sitting closer. and if you\u2019re brave and gutsy enough, you can even get up on the great stage. pay no attention to the stage crew, management is making sure they are taken care of. welcome to the greatest show on earth. they call it \u201cthe aristocrats.\u201d\n\nin contrast,  the entire bitcoin infrastructure operates based upon individuals freely and voluntarily interacting and exchanging with each other.   you might object that mining facilities still need property rights and violence. you're right about this!\n\nyes, each individual node in the bitcoin network still _does_ require physical infrastructure, and thus courts, armies, the rule of law, etc.  every fiber optic cable that makes up the network still does require a system of courts to resolve a situation in which a cow is buried upon the fiber cable, crushing the cable and blocking traffic.  what happens if that cable drifted into someone else\u2019s property due to tectonic shift. who\u2019s liable for the repair costs? and what of the emotional damage to old betsy\u2019s children who saw, from the corner of their factory farm, mama\u2019s corpse dug up by a backhoe? (this actually happened once - i spent years working at google on this kind of physical infra. not all of it, but the \u201ccow buried on a fiber cable\u201d part.)\n\nbut remember the concept of stacks! don't just stack your sats! stack your model of causality so that you can see how 'layers' of reality form computational stacks!\n\nhuman societies are stacks: commerce relies on the law, the law relies on violence.  bitcoin is a new layer on top of the existing stack which *doesn't need violence.*  we might think of bitcoin, again, by analogy to tcp - a purely consensual layer of global human interaction. even though individual packets can be dropped, tcp connections that use lossy packets can still reliably deliver messages.  \n\ntcp enables a form of communication that is pure and correct atop a system of noise and loss.  bitcoin - built atop of tcp - is the same, only it allows us to communicate about one of the most important aspects of human reality - the scarcity which constrains our material existence.   \n\nso yes, _pieces_ that make up bitcoin's infrastructure rely on violence - just as individual packets that make up a tcp message can indeed be lost.  just as the signals that make up an ethernet frame can be garbled or lost.  the powerful mathematics of information theory allowed humans to build lossless communication mechanisms atop of lossy ones. the powerful mathematics of computer science allowed us to build a violence-free way of interacting at scale.\n\nbitcoin, a nonviolent form of interacting, will become the new global norm. our old \u201cbefore satoshi\u201d politics are now meaningless! they are arguments over what we should do in the absence of bitcoin. \n\n\nbefore satoshi, all systems of property rights were built atop a system for projecting violence.  we might see all of before-satoshi politics as being arguments about the system of property ownership - who should pay for that system of violence, and how much? since we have this system for doing violence and enforcing property rights in place, what else should it do? anything? everything?\n\nthe best proof that bitcoin is nonviolent is to consider what happens in case of a future world war. bitcoin would still run. nations could cut themselves off of bitcoin, but capital controls have been notoriously difficult to enforce in history - especially in times of crisis. each nation state might lay claim to all of the resources inside of it, just as fdr grabbed everyone's gold prior to world war two, and both the nazi regime and the soviets insisted that it was the state that  has rights to all resources.  they _had_ to do this to fund their war. that world war can\u2019t happen today because the nation states can\u2019t seize property from their members, through heavy taxes and inflation, to pay for the war. britan just recently finished paying for debt from world war one, over a hundred years ago.  that is the nature of before-satoshi politics. debt and violence are the two ends of a pair of handcuffs.\n\nbefore satoshi, if your country was invaded, none of your property rights would be secure.\n\nafter satoshi, there is now a form of property rights that does not require any _specific_ system of violence at all.  after satoshi, if your country is invaded and taken over by a hostile power, you can leave with most of your wealth in your brain, and the invaders can't take it. they may not even know you _have_ it. this is a revolution in human affairs.\n\nbitcoin will likely enforce and protect property rights, not with one expensive hierarchical system of violence, but with numerous smaller systems that will be forced to compete on cost. hard money will pay for private defense, and invasion will be such a terrible investment that nobody would bother.  you can\u2019t seize wealth like invading armies used to.  nation states will still exist, they\u2019ll still skm off the top as always, but they\u2019ll be reduced to the status of homeowners associations.  most people dislike their hoa\u2019s, but none of our hoas has printed a trillion dollars or bombed their own citizens without trial or constructed a global panopticon that spies of all of us. the bad ones will annoy people enough that they will move out, and this will force them to change.  \n\n\n\nlet's call this situation what it is: the death of 'before satoshi' politics. after satoshi, new political coalitions and factions will emerge.  the old divisions are dead and busted. they only make sense before satoshi.\n\nit's time for politics after satoshi.\n\ncivilization has been a tottering tower to the heavens. bitcoin is an asteroid in geostationary orbit. it sustains and lifts the tower; it will turn this tower into a space elevator and get us off of this rock. yes, the tower heaves and sways. yes, it's scary. but see, the asteroid atop? it grows! with each sat you stack, you add mass, social inertia, gravitas, we will go to

wider blockchain industry will scale.\n\n[an incomplete guide to rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pwxcklcnsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pwxcklcnsu&t=1s)\n\nupdated on 14th october 2021. \n\n# rollups are a temporary band aid fix - x, y, z blockchain can do it on l1 so they don't need rollups\n\n(by u/hehechibby, u/ec265)\n\nrollups are the present and future of the blockchain industry.\n\nbut first, a brief perspective shift is required to understand why rollups are essential. until now, blockchains have had to do it all - execution, consensus/security and data availability. this has led to significant bottlenecks and inefficiencies, reflected in the blockchain trilemma. rollups are blockchains that are laser focused on one thing, and one thing exclusively: executing transactions as fast as possible, while \"outsourcing\" the hard work of security and data availability to a different l1 chain that is better at it. it's simple division of labour or specialization in action. just like it led exponential growth in the industrial revolution, so will it lead exponential increase in scalability for the blockchain industry.\n\nnow, x, y, z blockchain may have compromised significant amounts of decentralization and security to get high scalability, and ethereum and bitcoin may have compromised scalability to get high security and decentralization. rollups are simply constructions that can get the best of all worlds - with high scalability, security, *and* decentralization.\n\nthe important point is that it doesn't matter if it's an l1 or a rollup - to the user they are just interacting with an execution layer. **execution layers - l1s and rollups - should be directly compared with each other.** solana and avalanche are not competing with ethereum - they are competing with arbitrum one and starknet. \\[unless they pivot to a rollup-centric roadmap focusing on security and data availability, rather than execution - like ethereum and tezos have.\\]\n\n**tl;dr: whatever any l1 execution layer can do, a rollup can do it better.**\n\n# x, y, z blockchain is still faster than rollups\n\n[no.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) once again, whatever any l1 can do, a rollup can do it better long term. i'll point out that there's a wide-open design space with rollups, and some rollups will opt to have conservative rate limits - especially optimistic rollups. but with zkrs, they don't *have* to - they can push past the limits of l1s as described in the article linked above.\n\n# lack of composability is bad\n\n(by u/whovillage)\n\nthis is a common argument about rollups but it actually makes very little sense. as mentioned twice already, whatever any l1 can do, a rollup can do it better. i don't see anyone complaining about lack of composability between l1s?\n\na rollup remains fully composable, even if it's settled across multiple data shards or external data availability sources.\n\nlike l1s are not composable with each other, so are rollups not composable with each other. but there are many interoperability solutions live like hop, connext, cbridge and biconomy, and many more in the works. indeed, there's amazing innovations [like damm that lets multiple zkrollups share liquidity](https://medium.com/starkware/damm-decentralized-amm-59b329fb4cc3)! in addition, eventually we can have internally sharded zk rollups which retain full synchronous composability - a feat nigh impossible on l1s. \n\n**tl;dr: rollup composability is superior to l1s.**\n\n# fragmentation of liquidity is bad\n\n(by u/beef_lamborghinion)\n\nsee above, all of the same applies. rollups may not share liquidity, but neither do l1s. except, unlike l1s, they actually can with innovations like damm!\n\n**tl;dr: rollup liquidity fragmentation is less than l1 fragmentation.**\n\n# rollups are centralized\n\n(by u/whovillage)\n\nall transaction data (in compressed form) and proofs are published on l1, which enable exiting a rollup directly from l1 even if the rollup itself is compromised. so, security and decentralization of rollups = security and decentralization of l1. now, it's certainly true that rollups [may have centralized controls in the early days](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nl9cum/early_rollup_training_wheels/), but most if not all rollup projects are committed to progressive decentralization. the final form of rollups: zk rollups with decentralized sequencers, decentralized provers, decentralized l1 smart contracts and light unassisted exits - **you have security and decentralization that's practically identical to the most secure and decentralized security layer (currently ethereum), except with the massive scalability**.\n\n# casual users will never be able to execute the cex - ethereum mainnet - rollup journey / it's too expensive\n\n(by u/whovillage, u/stevieraykatz)\n\ntop cexs like okex, huobi and coinbase have committed to support withdrawals directly to (and deposits from) arbitrum one and other rollups with very low fees. bitfinex already supports withdrawals to hermez.\n\nmeanwhile, going through ethereum is not the only way into rollups. cbridge, for example, lets you enter arbitrum one through optimism, polygon pos, binance smart chain, xdai, avalanche or fantom. so, there are plenty of options already, and there'll be many more over time as cexs and fiat ramps integrate, and liquidity builds up for these various solutions. argent is releasing with direct fiat on-ramps to zksync and other rollups soon. with account abstraction, innovative fee models, and meta-transactions - the user experience can actually be better. we can already see this on dydx - all gas is abstracted from the user. all the user sees is instant transactions without ever having to worry about gas - a ux better than any l1. \n\n**tl;dr: the ux is better than any l1.** \n\n# it takes too long to withdraw from rollups\n\nthis is true for optimistic rollups - take 7 days to withdraw from rollup to l1 using the default bridge. however, as mentioned above, there are multiple options available that let you make a fast withdrawal for fungible assets. of course, zkrollups don't have this limitation. for nfts, zkrs are thus a preferred solution. \n\n# rollups will be obsolete after \"eth 2.0\"\n\nfirstly, [\"eth2\" is deprecated nomenclature](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/great-renaming). the two major upgrades coming to ethereum next are the merge which merges the consensus layer (previously eth2) with the execution layer (previously eth1) - so we're all one ethereum again! the next major upgrade after that is data sharding on the consensus layer side. data sharding is actually focused on accelerating rollups. so, ethereum l1 scalability will be limited for the foreseeable future, while rollups will scale through the roof!\n\n**tl;dr: ethereum's roadmap is rollup-centric and designed to accelerate and empower rollups.**\n\n# rollups are still too expensive\n\nthis is true, in the short term. optimistic rollups like arbitrum one and optimistic ethereum are reducing fees by 90%-95% currently, which while a huge improvement over ethereum is still too expensive. with some optimizations like signature aggregation, better batching and calldata compression, this can be reduced to 99%. indeed, zkrollups are already seeing 99% reductions getting fees down to the $0.10-$1 range even when l1 fees are high. dydx is already doing transaction fees in the \\~$0.10 for complex defi derivative trades - although this is abstracted away from the end users to be gas-free. \n\nbut it doesn't stop here! when ethereum releases data shards, rollup costs will absolutely plummet, with over a magnitude greater capacity unlocked overnight, scaling up to several orders of magnitude long term.\n\nyou can get a preview of that with validiums like immutable x, where it costs less than a cent to mint an nft. indeed, it's so cheap that immutable x is subsidizing it, so it currently costs $0.00 to mint an nft with your ethereum wallet! [try it out for yourself on swiftmint](https://swiftmint.io/). i'll note that validiums are not as secure as rollups, but they are more secure than sidechains and other l1s. volitions further extend this by giving users the choice between rollup and validium - best of all worlds!\n\n**tl;dr: in the long term, rollups + data shards will offer the greatest scale and lowest fees possible for given demand.**\n\n# rollup finality is slow\n\nrollup sequencers give you \"soft confirmations\" nearly instantly - for me this is \\~0.3 seconds on average for a uniswap trade on arbitrum or optimism. for most people, this soft confirmation is fine. but it's true that l1 finality is often delayed, especially in the case of zkrs. starknet has a great solution [with checkpoints achieving effective finality](https://ethresear.ch/t/checkpoints-for-faster-finality-in-starknet/9633) on the rollup side very quickly, at which point the finality is as fast as the l1 can finalize. as zk tech improves, ethereum implements single-slot finality and data shards are staggered, we will see finality drop to a few seconds. you can also have a consensus mechanism on a rollup that finalizes fast - just like any l1 would - so you get the same experience, but additional security. but this gives up efficiencies gained from being a rollup. \n\nall that said, there may be some niche usecases where settling directly on l1 still makes sense without bolstering security - but this is a very small niche.\n\n# rollups are an ethereum thing and bound by evm and solidity\n\nrollups are definitely not just an ethereum thing. indeed, [tezos is embracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqbss0dsuzq) a rollup-centric roadmap. arthur breitman, founder of tezos, actually makes one of the best arguments for why rollups are the ultimate scalability solution, in tandem with data shards. [near is also designing for sharded data availability](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1437323779420696578). celestia is building a security & da layer exclusively for rollups. \n\nfurther, rollups have a wide open design space. they can experiment with vms, fee models, coordination mechanisms, governance etc. indeed, the room for innovation is much wider than l1s - given they always have a fallback on the most secure l1. want a quantum-resistant vm? use starknet. like your utxos? use fuel v2. like llvm and rust? use zksync 2.0. just want a chain optimized for one specific application? sure, use immutable x for nfts. want a fully private chain: use aztec. wasm? arbitrum. any vm, any programming language, any data model - a rollup can do it all. indeed, it can innovate beyond any l1 with clever fee & tokenomics models (see: immutable x's imx token), governance structures, etc. \n\n**tl;dr: rollups have a wide-open design space, and anything any l1 can do, so can rollups, and then some.**\n\n# why is ethereum special, if you can deploy rollups elsewhere?\n\nrollups will leverage whatever is the most secure and decentralized l1 with the highest data availability that can support it.\n\nit's clear ethereum is orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any smart contract platform. realistically, bitcoin is the only other chain that's comparable, but of course, they lack the ability to host rollups.\n\nethereum doesn't currently have the highest data availability, but it will, with data sharding. meanwhile, we have validiums offering ample data availability with security that's still superior to other l1s. data sharding inverts the trilemma - the more decentralized your network is, the more data shards you can deploy, and the more scalable your rollups will be. this is how rollups that deploy on ethereum will scale to millions of tps over the years, [speculatively up to 15 million tps by 2030](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/ojafms/conjecture_how_far_can_rollups_data_shards_scale/). the only area where ethereum can be improved is the execution layer - to make it more friendly for verifying zk-sn(t)arks. i'm sure it will, once the merge, data shards and statelessness are done.\n\nit's clear, then, that ethereum is uniquely positioned to be the best host for rollups. but this is not to say that there can't be other contenders. if ethereum's data shards are saturated, we'll see data availability chains like celestia or avail potentially taking up the slack. other l1s who are embracing a rollup-centric model, like tezos, may also benefit if there's an overflow of demand from ethereum-based rollups. and of course, the elephant in the room is an unexpected new competitor, though realistically, the only real competitor is if bitcoin somehow adds the functionality to verify zk-snarks and implements data sharding.\n\nfor the rollups, it doesn't really matter. they'll just leverage whatever l1 offers them the best security, decentralization, network effect and data availability.\n\n**tl;dr: ethereum is uniquely positioned to offer the highest security, decentralization, and data availability - making it the defacto standard host for rollups.**\n\n# rollups are stealing traffic from ethereum\n\nethereum execution is fully saturated, and has had full blocks for years now. all activity on rollups is net additive. now, some may argue sharding would have expanded ethereum's capacity - but rollups + data shards in tandem increase the overall capacity of the ethereum ecosystem by several orders of magnitude more than the previous sharding solution.\n\n# rollups are too complicated, no one will understand it\n\nmight i just point out i'm writing this on the day that arbitrum one has proven to be the fastest growing smart contract platform in history? in reality, the ux for using a rollup is identical to that of using an l1, as covered before. users need not care about the underlying architecture - to them it's just another smart contract platform. do youtube users care about what programming language it was written in, what os the servers run on, what hardware the servers implement, what internet connection they use etc.? of course not. indeed, [i expect things will improve significantly with smart contract wallets and centralized frontends](https://polynya.medium.com/a-vision-of-ethereum-2025-bb92a0d4dc4f).\n\n# when rollups get big enough they will just abandon the base chain and create their own blockchain\n\n(by u/whovillage)\n\ntechnically, this is possible. however, what makes a rollup special is that it's backed by the most secure and decentralized l1. this is the hardest bit, evidently so as only bitcoin and ethereum have managed to achieve it. arbitrum one has already demonstrated that there's exponentially more demand for a chain backed by ethereum's security than a more centralized consensus mechanism. on a related note, as alluded to earlier, if there's a competitor that offers better security and data availability than ethereum, then rollups will be well incentivized to migrate. which is fine, and will keep ethereum core researchers and developers honest.\n\n# there are no rollup tokens, so people won't be invested in the ecosystems\n\nthis is not quite true. while there are many rollup projects in their early stage and do not yet have a token, i expect most rollups to eventually release a token. many rollup projects do have tokens, and are using them in innovative ways - like immutable x. just another advantage for rollups over l1s - you can have unique and clever token and fee models.\n\n# it's too expensive to compute a zero-knowledge proof\n\ntrue, but by amortizing this over many transactions, the costs become negligible relative to gas paid for transaction calldata. of course, we're still in the early days of zero-knowledge tech, and we'll see costs and time for computing zk proofs plummet over time. software optimizations, gpu/fpgas/asics, moore's law, and growing adoption with more transactions means things will only get better for zkrollups, which have already proved to be sustainable.\n\n# can nfts transfer easily between l1 and rollups and between rollups?\n\n(by u/datacruncha)\n\nthis is a great question that i had overlooked. while there are multiple bridges for fungible tokens, as mentioned above, nfts are more complicated because you can't have liquidity bridges. currently, yes, you can transfer nfts between l1s and rollups, but the solutions are definitely early workarounds. for example, on zksync 1.x, you can mint an nft there, and when you withdraw to l1, it's simply burned on zksync 1.x and minted as an erc-721 on l1. cross-rollup is definitely an unresolved problem. fortunately, this is being actively researched, and there's a lot of discussion on a [recent wrapped nfts proposal by vitalik](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507) to make nfts easily transferable cross rollups. jordi baylina from polygon hermez [further expands upon it](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507/28) but really there are many insightful comments in that thread (and some low-quality trolling too!).\n\n# you're talking about the future, execution risks remain\n\nthis is absolutely true. rollups are nascent technology, and [it'll take a couple of years to mature](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/paipgj/why_the_transition_to_rollupcentric_ethereum_is_a/) and live up to their potential. things can go wrong. fair enough, but i do make it very

some of the best and most tested methods to farm karma on r/ethereum.\n\n**1.gas too high:**\n\nmake sure there is $0.5 to $1 in your metamask account. then go interact with any ethereum smart contracts. on your metamask, go to edit gas, and crank gas limits to 9999999. then you'll get absurd values like $15,000 for the swap/deposit/withdrawal/whateverthefuckhaveyou. take the fucking screenshot!!!! you're done. post it online. ggwp. fucking eth is robbing you $15,000 for a $1 transaction, fuck me right?!\n\n**2.gas too high:**\n\nwhen minting nfts, make sure you wait till all nfts have been fully minted. there's a bug in metamask that, when an nft is sold out, you'll receive absurdly high gas like 5 eth for one mint. metamask hasn't updated that hole yet, so here's your chance to farm more karma. take the fucking screenshot of the mint. post it on twitter. fuck me, now ethereum wants to rob you of your $25k for a fucking jpeg, fuck me right?\n\n**3.gas too high:**\n\n*\"hey guys. wtf?! i'm a new investor with $100 in my wallet. i literally can't do anything right now. why does it take me $500 to transfer my money anywhere with etherium??? $500 is literally a lifelong

of moons and karma in no time. good luck!\n\n**4.gas too high:**\n\nmake sure this time you're swapping $5 worth of eth into some other coins. remember, the swap needs to be as low as possible or this farming technique won't work! again, crank gas limits up to 99999. go to etherscan, check twitter for a hot nft drop, wait till network hits 1000 gwei for 15 seconds. now open your metamask asap. go to swap, screenshot the fucking picture. now you have proof that ethereum wants you to pay $10,000 to swap $5 worth of your hard earned money. fucking robbed, i say! fuck me sideways and call me betty, right?\n\n**5.gas too high:**\n\n*\"nobody uses eartherium anymore. it's too crowded. too many people are using it. nobody is using it anymore. i don't understand how etherium is still a thing. gas too high!!! why are people still using it? it's literally dead.\"*\n\nthat's another pre-made essay you can use to get some solid internet points. this essay is meant to prove your undisputable prowess in your understanding of basic supply/demand in economics. you'll get to be a fucking genius and get karma, what's not to like? spam this every time all the time.\n\n**6.gas too high:**\n\nfuck me. now you're a vc fund with billions under management. of course ethereum $50 gas bothers you because you are here for the common man, the average working man, the 9-5 joes and the housewife janes, right? fuck me. it bleeds your fucking croc - i mean, human heart to see 'em unable to pay them gas fees. fuck me. what do you do? well, you go on twitter, you say you're abandoning

fuck.\n\n\\---------------\n\nwell, fuck me, that's all i got for you right now. as you can see, those are 6 very diverse and different topics you can pick anytime you want to keep your karma farming techniques varied. you can rotate them whenever you want, it should be enough materials to last you an entire week if you rotate between r/ethereum, r/cc  and other kripto subs. shouldn't run out of

same history, without having to collude, or be controlled by a master\n\nsatoshi chose back's hashcash mechanism because it uses hashing as a random oracle, and using a random oracle separates the timestamping process (mining, creating the chain's next block) from the contents of the block (transactions)\n\nthe miners compete in a race using a process which is independent of the transactions they are adding to the transaction history. a miner hashes only the header of his block, and only the merkle root hash connects the header to the transaction set. because the merkle hash is a hash of pairs of pairs of pairs of merkle tree node hashes, it is several steps removed from the actual transaction data\n\nproof of stake determines the contents of the next block by choosing a staker according to a partially random mechanism, biased by the quantity of coins being staked. the stakers' coins are part of the transaction history. this link - using existing transaction history to establish new transaction history - is a vector for corrupt alteration of the history\n\nalso, a proof-of-work chain embodies elapsed time in the work. that is, rewriting old history requires re-doing the work in the old block, and every descendant of the altered block. an attacker can never succeed because the chain is being extended faster than the time he needs to catch up to the tip\n\na proof-of-stake chain can be considered as a checkpoint in time, not an accumulation of time. the entire history can be rewritten with no work, because no work was expended to build it\n\nthe new cool kid on the block\n\nnew does not mean better. proof of stake really is a joke\n\nfundamental to the design of bitcoin - the work is separate from the validation. the pos coin refers to the miner as validator. bitcoin does validation after mining. bitcoin miners are not trusted to provide valid transactions in valid blocks\n\nand that leads to centralization concerns. bitcoin is decentralized in its node network, where the miners are not trusted by nodes, and where nodes do not trust nodes. validation is repeated by every node, trusting only itself\n\nthe pos coin trusts the staker as validator, centralizing the validation role in the highest value stakers.\u201d\n\ncrossposted from r/bitcoin . to me the checkpoint vs history analogy seems a particularly damning argument describing how pos is not truly a blockchain in terms of having an immutable history. even if a miner achieves 51% hashing power, they can only alter the future not the past. \n\nsecondly, it may be possible to forge a transaction that gives a person over 51% of stake, and use that to continue mining, since \u201cvalidation\u201d and \u201ctransactions\u201d are related, unlike with pos. is this not an

yourself.\n\n&#x200b;\n>  \n>**people say** *pos is better for the rich because all they need to do is to buy the token and then stake it to earn more coins and therefore more power.* this conflates two points;  \n>  \n>one that having more coins == more power (this is true to an extent but unless you have a large percentage of staked eth (for example), it is not much more *useful* voting power because of a built-in protocol function that randomizes your voting power so large players are unlikely to be the *deciding* vote on many blocks back to back. (and by unlikely i mean statistically *very* low, *even* if you have over 50% of the staked eth, although, admittedly, this does increase your voting power exponentially after 50%)  \n>  \n>the 2nd point is suggesting that a pow system is much different. if i have 10,000 of your local currency to spend on equipment, then i would probably have very little chance of mining blocks for myself so i join a pool and pay a small fee to a pool so they can smooth out my income. this is cool because most people can participate and use energy to turn into bitcoin that is generated from the base block reward, and not from an existing pool of coins. joining a pool is not necessarily good for decentralization though. however, if i have 10,000,000 of your local currency to spend on equipment, not only can i move myself to a place that has low power costs, increasing my profit margins comparatively (granting me more coins per unit of energy than other miners thereby making me richer than them for the same amount of work) but i could reasonably 'go it alone' with that amount of capital which is actually beneficial to the network. this is a classic case of the rich getting richer. the only difference is that the miners have to have *physical* equipment rather than using collateral that is the network coin itself.  \n>  \n>**tldr for point 1**. both consensus mechanisms have their own flavor of the rich getting richer.  \n>  \n>**2. people say** that having a lot of a **p**roof **o**f **s**take coin will help an institution collude and manipulate the protocol. this is actually a possibility, but it is very unlikely due to what would immediately happen to their collateral. the reason behind this is that you must understand that just like a hardfork can be perpetuated by a silent majority of people so too can a fork of a pos network. lets say there is a certain coin that starts with e and an investment company purchases a large chunk of the coin. cool, those who sold their coins to this institution are well off because they decided to sell their coins and they don't care, they got their money. this is good because it shakes out the loose hands and makes number go up. but boom, out of nowhere this institution stakes all of their coins and now controls 50% of the network. as explained earlier, this is not necessarily the end of the road for this token because they would need more than 50% to actually statistically have a good shot at having the deciding vote in proposing several blocks back to back. the protocol would also detect double spend activity and slash the offending validators thereby removing their power. but lets say that the protocol failed and somehow the institution circumvented the protocol and got away with it. then the rest of the staking community can just stick to *their* version of the network fork just like when btc forked and the more popular chain wins out. game theory time. yes, institutions *can*  stake more than 50% of a coin, but the silent majority will just not recognize that chain as the official chain even if the rich institutions *do* recognize that at the legit chain and then the silent majority will vote with their feet and buy from the institutions that back the **community** driven chain and **not the one** **stolen** by the large institution. this would give two perspectives. from the large institution's perspective they would have a fork version that they have control of the network, *but no users.* from the perspective of the community it would look like half of the tokens in circulation were bought, staked, and then burned thereby forever lowering the amount in circulation. the institution would just have burned billions worth of their tokens... for nothing.  \n>  \n>there is a deeper point here as well. with a pow chain like btc 51% attacks *if they were ever perpetuated* would not have much recourse to stopping the attacks. the community can vote to change the mining algorithm thereby stopping the attacks for a while, but they can only do that a few times before it doesn't become effective. at that point, the community is beholden to that user getting bored and stopping their attack. unless someone physically destroyed the offending attacker's computer they would not have much recourse other than changing mining algos. with pos the offending attacker's collateral is just destroyed because it is not a physical hardware device but is  stored on the blockchain and the protocol has strict punishments for rule breakers.  \n>  \n>**tldr for point 2:** collusion is possible, but it doesn't end well for the colluders.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**3.** **people say** that having more coin entitles you to receiving more rewards, but that is the same as saying that having a $100 earning 10 percent entitles you to a bigger return than having $1,000,000 earning 10 percent. yes, it is *true* that you get more of a return in **absolute** values, but you still get the same amount p*ercentage* yield with different amounts of coins. this also doesn't take into account that there are small *decentralized* staking pools that allow users with very little stake to still participate and earn their relative portion of the rewards.  \n>  \n>**tldr for point 3:** 5% on 1,000 is the same percentage as 5% on 10,000. it is still 5%.", {"entities":

usually (but not always) iterative upon previous blockchains. so, for example, the ethereum blockchain allows for more sophistication surrounding smart contracts as opposed to older blockchains such as the bitcoin network. therefore it's imaginable that several new blockchains might be developed in the future that essentially supersede existing ones such that they become much more popular with users.\n\nso here is my question: if the buyer of an nft has their ownership verified on a blockchain such as ethereum, what is to stop someone creating a nft of the same object (e.g. nyan cat) on a new blockchain in the future, essentially stealing it? is this impossible because newly developed blockchains use data from pre-existing chains (such as ethereum) rather than starting from scratch? because surely if a new ledger is developed that starts from scratch then all the data that is present on older blockchains that prove the ownership of a particularly expensive nft will no longer be present thus allowing a new owner to claim the nft?\n\ni am guessing that my understanding is probably incomplete somehow on this topic but the thought popped into my mind when i heard about people spending a lot of money on a nft nyan cat or the first tweet. maybe in 10-20 years time or hell even 5 years when technology has progressed in a manner which we can't predict then maybe those nft

startups rely on facebook advertising services, google search suggestions, and amazon's aws service to survive. artists and creators face the risk of having their information deleted from sites like spotify, instagram and tiktok. although these are not new problems, it is becoming more and more serious. the development of technology monopolies and their scalability to information privacy rights and personal freedoms has spurred the internet transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0\n\n# what is web 3.0?\n\nweb 3.0 (commonly called web3) is a reform model aimed at democratising the internet. web 3.0 is present in the crypto space and other digital fields such as ai, virtual and augmented reality, and more. by applying new technologies, web 3.0 is changing how we, as a collective, view and value the internet. web 3.0 is about creating an internet that works for everyone, owned by everyone.\n\n# where web 3.0 comes from\n\nthe term was originally coined in 2014 and popularised in 2018 by ethereum co-founder and polkadot founder gavin wood. the spirit of this term goes back to when satoshi developed bitcoin and advocated decentralised dns called\u00a0bitdns.\n\n>\u201ci think it would be possible for bitdns to be a completely separate network and separate blockchain, yet share cpu power with bitcoin.\u201d - satoshi (2010)\n\ndns has long been controlled by organisations such as verisign and the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) overseen by the us department of commerce. this centralised control of dns has been used to enforce ip rights, prohibit websites from selling copyrighted material, censor free-of-speech sites like\u00a0wikileaks\u00a0and seize domain names (ip addresses) without proper procedures, etc. censorship decisions are usually influenced by the top levels of government and the lobbyists of the largest multinational organisations, who may not always be acting in the best interests of the general public.satoshi and other bitcoin enthusiasts recognised this. in 2011, a fork of bitcoin called namecoin was born to allow censorship-proof domains at\u00a0*.bit*\u00a0domain addresses.namecoin was ahead of its time. a proxy service or extension (such as metamask today) was required to log in at the\u00a0*.bit*\u00a0domain, making it very difficult to use. plus, most people did not want their own website or personal domain at that time. all of this caused namecoin to fail because of low demand from its users.ten years later and now new blockchains and decentralised services may be ready for success. these applications are making the internet more decentralised with web 3.0. another example of such infrastructure is the\u00a0handshake network.", {"entities": [[2493, 2500, "crypto"], [2677, 2684,

there are far more other types of quarters making this more equivalent to throwing a bucket of coins into the air and predicting the outcome of the same select 5 two 2x in a row.\n\ndoge is also in that pipeline. the efforts of the anti looting teeth or resistance latter is a collective effort to stabilize doge.\n\n\nyou may rememeber the days when btc or ltc would drop and loot 2x+ from doge to supplement.\n\nnow the factor is about 1/2\n\nthe bots are easy to farm and to tame. check out the top commentor who admits his only role is to down vote any deep dive.\n\nwe got him to begin talking about bots for us\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/rwtbjqm lol\n\nuse the bots to your advantage. whoever controls the bots controls the game.\n\nthis is the morning we prematurely triggered the ltc nosedive giving it only 1 hours before market hours to try to recover. but there's a reason why we always push up against the clock...\n\nwe started off as a splinter of anonymous, a call to anyone who is willing. but we'd rather keep anomymous neutral since sometimes things go way to far.... the june events were exactly what we planned for minus the 2 deaths. the gauntlet being dropped in the anonynous video should have kept things civil...\n\nmcafee (rip) used to be the elon of btc but very recently did a 180 on it and his explaining why would be as obvious as why he teamed up with me to promote knox back in the days of the s7.\n\ni wouldn't have had the success i had if it wasn't for him.... i can only suspect the drug use turned him into a loose cannon.\n\nnot all is fair in love and war. otherwise there would be a lot more people dead. war is abstracted to the game and we intend to follow the rules and keep things that way.\n\nbut for now it's the time to get as many doge wallets out there as possible. get creative or just simply tell a corner store you can take doge and forgo credit card fees.\n\nit's really not as hard as it seems. there are more of the plurality getting into doge as possible which is a good thing. less \"whales\" means calmer waters and a million drops of water can wear through solid stone from whence a delicate sapling can sprout against all \"odds\" i. e. leverage. \n\nit can also volume shock the market to its knees...\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mz7swfr\n\nif you want me to pull from the scrap book the day after 2ws reported as the lowest volume trading day in modern history.... that's what happens when you collectively employ volume blast the hft pipelines. \n\npress play. last guidance from mcafee was to create your own metrics because no numbers can be trusted online.\n\nlook at the number of comments shadow banned here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qv2y37/to_those_who_were_paying_attention_remember_the\n\nit wasn't even supposed to be a dislogue but a signal to drive down ltc.\n\nyet more than 50 comments were shadow banned and most lkelly none of them even know it. if you see your comment there no one else does which is why i always mention to just don't bother responding publicly or voting. just dm. if you want to vote you're better off trying to get the post to the most controversial section because 60+ percent of the vote is botted..\n\n\u2122", {"entities": [[4833, 4841,

recently, 2018 study [de souza, m.j.s., ramos, d.g.f., pena, m.g. *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-018-0087-z) made the following conclusion on a broad review of ta strategies in brics equity markets:\n\n&#x200b;\n\n>**\u201con average, the returns obtained using technical analysis surpassed the value invested.\u201d**\n\nthese studies sometimes contradict each other, but pretty much all of them have commonalities:\n\n* ta is more effective when performed in less efficient markets\n* higher frequency of trading is correlated with lower returns via ta\n* ta aided by fundamental analysis is more effective\n* ta is more effective in less mature markets\n\nperhaps these points help explain why ta is so effective in crypto markets, especially with altcoins. altcoin markets are immature, less efficient, and can be evaluated fundamentally. retail investors have a further advantage in that they don\u2019t need to make frequent trades.\n\n**when is technical analysis valid?**\n\ni don't think the average crypto investor can make their whole trading career out of technical analysis, but it can definitely help you:\n\n* inform longer-term investment decisions alongside fundamental analysis\n* help you time exits\n* get better entry points for swing trades.\n\nall of these advantages are valuable enough that it\u2019s worth understanding, at minimum, the basic foundations.\n\n**a note**\n\nin this analysis, i\u2019m going to be starting from the most basic technical analysis concepts. if you already understand technical analysis, this article might just be a way to brush up on the basics or one to skip.\n\n# the foundation: supply and demand\n\nall technical analysis comes down to one thing: understanding supply and demand. if there are more buyers (demand) than sellers (supply), the price will move upwards. more demand than supply? the price will go up. much of technical analysis comes down to identifying where that supply and demand lies and making your investment based on that info.\n\ni find it a healthy exercise to reflect on the fact that, in every trade, there is one buyer and one seller: for any investment idea you have, there is someone on the other side thinking the exact opposite. and one of you will be wrong. it's a humbling concept, but one that will definitely make you think twice.\n\n# resistance/support\n\nwhen a cryptocurrency bounces off a certain price level twice, that could indicate a place of resistance or support. that is to say, there are a lot of people looking to trade at that price and the crypto will have a harder time breaking out above or falling below.\n\n**resistance**\n\nresistance is the tendency for an asset to approach a given price and fall back down just before or right after hitting it. it often happens at round numbers, because sellers concentrate supply around prices like $100 or $1000 or $60,000.\n\ncheck out the example below where bitcoin bounced off of its previous all-time high (resistance) before breaking through:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv9lpth6ze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f9335fb0608603b3a2c18916d07cbc3cef2749\n\n**support**\n\nonce a crypto breaks through a resistance price level, it often becomes support. support is a floor that an asset\u2019s price bounces off of. this can represent a good buying opportunity because frequently, after a crypto makes this critical test, momentum changes. many investors wait for that bounce to make a directional trade and buy at the lowest possible price.\n\nfor an example, check out the chart below for ethereum, where it broke through, then bounced off, the $3,000 price level for a few weeks.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6uww9a7ze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb52f407bcd62f4211c9f3676382daf13c3b2810\n\ni like this tweet from three arrows capital investor su zhu on trading support and resistance:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6r78uu7ze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=068d986805d0fad009b436fef285552a398e8aea\n\n# channels\n\nchannels are just what they sound like, two walls of prices that an asset is range-bound within. it's a combination of resistance and support\n\nchannels can trend up, down, or sideways. when channels trend sideways, it\u2019s often seen as an opportunity to accumulate a crypto.\n\nwhen these channels exist, there are a few possibilities for making money:\n\n* make a trade at the bottom hoping for a bounce\n* make a trade at the top hoping for a rejection\n* make a directional trade after a breakout\n\nhere's an example of what it looks like with dag crypto [coti](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coti)\n\n# breakouts\n\na breakout happens when a crypto moves above a support area or below a resistance area. when identified correctly, this tends to be accompanied by a big move, either up or down, and thus a big opportunity. it happens a lot when a crypto hits, and then passes, an all-time high.\n\nbelow is a chart of bitcoin last year where it encountered resistance at its 2017 ath, then broke out with a big move to the upside:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68fck5g9ze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe1a08440ee2d8308ff6a77a87eb4496410f259\n\n# moving averages\n\nlike price levels of support and resistance, moving averages are often areas of resistance and support as well.\n\n**simple moving average**\n\nthe concept of a simple moving average is, well, actually a little complicated: it is the \u201carithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation.\u201d it's basically the average price over the last period of time, plotted on a continuous line.\n\nthese moving averages end up being bands of prices that sit below the asset price in bullish times and above the asset price in bearish times.\n\nif you\u2019ve ever heard the term \u2018death cross\u2019 or \u2018golden cross,\u2019 it comes from moving averages. golden crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the upside, and often signals a pump in price. death crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the downside.\n\nyou can see the chart below as an example of what moving averages look like on a chart as well as what it looks like when they cross.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eszho89bze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6826bd9ef2962308a226392d4f4cc7e20688be98\n\n**exponential moving average**\n\nthe ema is similar to the sma, although it places more weight on recent prices. it\u2019s used in a similar way, to find buy and sell signals when it serves as resistance or support or when it crosses another moving average.\n\n# volume\n\nyou know those little bars at the bottom of a price chart, below the graph? those bars reflect volume--the amount of a given cryptocurrency, in dollars, traded over a time period.\n\nvolume can help us detect momentum\u2014a word used when a trend in a cryptocurrency is accompanied by large volume.\n\nincreased volume signals that whatever trend you're seeing is important. with more volume, we can see that more and more participants are pricing in new information, and that more participants are entering or exiting the market for that asset.\n\na price drop on very low volume probably isn\u2019t a huge reason to be concerned. a price drop on enormous volume means there\u2019s something big happening. see the may ethereum selloff for a good example of how high volume signaled a short bear market:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pwgn804ze181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf8c61ecdc1fc23bbf4c0a6570ef8ba8402a4\n\n# rsi\n\nrsi is a stat that ranges between 1 and 100 and attempts to show momentum. the calculation is a bit rough, but the basic idea is that if rsi is above 70, the crypto is overbought and might be due for a trend reversal. below 30 and it could be undervalued, ready to pull out of a downward slide.\n\nit's a bit more nuanced and must be used in conjunction with price data to be well understood. the fact that cryptos can remain 'overbought' or 'undervalued' for long periods of time makes it even more difficult to get right.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am9kweh3ze181.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e1df948141de778d0ac1a533a177134e6ff9c7d\n\n**platforms for technical analysis**\n\nfor charting, tradingview is definitely the most popular service and it\u2019s free, although it\u2019s got a premium subscription available. the charts in this article all came from tradingview. coinigy and cryptowat.ch are also well-known services. i'd recommend tradingview just because it's so widely used.\n\n**the limitations (and infinite possibilities) of technical analysis**\n\ntechnical analysis is a tree that branches out in endless directions. on-chain analysts (market observers that look at public blockchain data) combine ta with other metrics. they combine these new metrics to make even more metrics derived from the first layer of ta statistics. it can make your head spin.\n\nthere are so many signals and patterns to identify that it often becomes difficult to find the patterns that are really important. as with everything, it comes down to practice, experience, introspection, research, and learning.\n\nit\u2019s really, really difficult to become a trader on solely technical analysis. when your money is on the line, it\u2019s easy to get emotional or overinvested in a narrative. an altcoin that\u2019s pumping is really hard to sell and will look like it can go forever. stories can be constructed in your own head.\n\ni think ta is best used in combination with other skills: position sizing, fundamental analysis, diversification, profit taking. it's another way to improve your arsenal as an investor, not a golden bullet.\n\ngood luck out there!\n\n&#x200b;\n\n**edit: thanks for the upvotes! i know reddit hates self-promo, but if you liked this, you'll love my

#dingopack**\n\ngiving you guys an awareness post about dingocoin since it has gained a bunch of steam since it was posted on cryptomoonshots! average price has climbed from $0.000003 to $0.000008 so far, and market cap has breached the $1,000,000 mark the other day. anyways, on to the post, happy reading!\n\n**what\u2019s dingocoin?**\n\n\ndingocoin is a scrypt auxpow mining coin with it's own blockchain, forked from dogecoin on april fools\u2019 2021. it started off all alone with a tiny discord server, but users quickly flocked to it, mining, chatting and slowly building up a community-driven dev team. dingocoin focuses on building itself as the awesome ultimate currency, with absolutely no unnecessary bullshit features.\n\n\n**features**\n\ndue to dingocoin's purebred nature of not being a token reliant on a separate network with insane gas fees, dingocoin is sustainable as an actual currency similar to dogecoin. with active community devs, dingocoin has built a 1:1 bsc wrapped token that is powered through nodes run by community members to ensure decentralized wrapping. we are also actively working on a sol wrapping, as well as games on discord which utilize dingocoins.\n\n- exists on both its own blockchain and also on bsc, wrapped using a unique community-secured system.\n\n- rug-pull proof: literally listed on 17 pairs over 6 exchanges.\n\n- double spend attacks impossible due to custom reorg-resistant code.\n\n- highly decentralized mining: merge-mined on 3 of the top 25 ltc+doge pools, sharing ~1% of all ltc+doge hashrate.\n\n- no stupid features of ponzi schemes. \n\n\n**sick and tired of \"shit tokens\"? look no further!**\n\nrecent trends in crypto focus on boring tokens with unjustified uses. these have dumb features like high transaction fees, which are re-distributed to existing holders in a bid to encourage holding and shilling. they also justify the token as a necessity for \u201cuses\u201d such as donations, games, and marketplaces; when these can practically run off any currency ever. these form the very definition of a ponzi scheme. if you ever think that a useless asset with 10% transaction fees can ever become a legitimate currency, then you should throw a dollar in the trash every time you lend your mother 10 bucks and see how long you both put up with it. it gets tiring, fast.\n\ndingocoin focuses on the right thing --  being a currency with minimal transaction fees. we have no dumb ponzi mechanisms in place. pay only for network fees, and nothing more. the goal is to maximize adoption as much as possible. you can use the games, marketplaces, etc., that community members have been working on, if you happen to have dingocoin; but we will never mislead, coerce, or lie to users that they should get dingocoin just to access these.\n\n**exchanges & pricing**\n\ndingocoin is looking to continue moving upward and break into even larger crypto exchanges (more on that below!). as of this writing, dingocoin is currently listed on 16 pairs over 5 exchanges, plus pancakeswap for the bsc token. as of this writing, the average price is ~~$0.000003~~ $0.000008 and climbing. dingocoin has a supply comparable to dogecoin, yet its market cap is still extremely low at ~~170k~~ 835k usd. a 5000x increase to $0.01 per dingocoin is peanuts at this rate \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t even be as high as doge (1b+) in market cap! \n\n\n**future & limitless potential**\n\nwith a community dev team more active than dogecoin's, dingocoin has the potential to find a place in the cryptosphere above and beyond dogecoin.  with only a relatively few exchanges listing dingocoin, the opportunities for arbitrage exist. other than the wrapped bsc token, the community dev team is hard at work on the solana wrapped dingocoin. a \"dingosino\" is being developed for the community discord where users can play table games with their dingocoin. also, a community member has created a \"social faucet\" where if you post about dingocoin on twitter, you get rewarded dingocoins and can redeem them once a week! the information (and leaderboard!) is on the main dingocoin.org website. the community dev team is welcoming to any one else who has an idea or a project they would like to integrate dingocoin into. if you can dream it, it's possible with dingocoin and it's strong, secure blockchain. in fact, as of 2 weeks ago, a community member secured an offer with hotbit, a top 30 exchange by number of visits in the world (and recently has secured a us trading license!), and is currently working with other community members to arrange the resources required to be listed there. talk about quick work! a hotbit listing is pending and will happen soon. to the moon!\n\n\n**resources & thanks**\n\nwebsite:

recently, 2018 study [de souza, m.j.s., ramos, d.g.f., pena, m.g. *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-018-0087-z) made the following conclusion on a broad review of ta strategies in brics equity markets:\n\n&#x200b;\n\n>**\u201con average, the returns obtained using technical analysis surpassed the value invested.\u201d**\n\nthese studies sometimes contradict each other, but pretty much all of them have commonalities:\n\n* ta is more effective when performed in less efficient markets\n* higher frequency of trading is correlated with lower returns via ta\n* ta aided by fundamental analysis is more effective\n* ta is more effective in less mature markets\n\nperhaps these points help explain why ta is so effective in crypto markets, especially with altcoins. altcoin markets are immature, less efficient, and can be evaluated fundamentally. retail investors have a further advantage in that they don\u2019t need to make frequent trades.\n\n**when is technical analysis valid?**\n\ni don't think the average crypto investor can make their whole trading career out of technical analysis, but it can definitely help you:\n\n* inform longer-term investment decisions alongside fundamental analysis\n* help you time exits\n* get better entry points for swing trades.\n\nall of these advantages are valuable enough that it\u2019s worth understanding, at minimum, the basic foundations.\n\n**a note**\n\nin this analysis, i\u2019m going to be starting from the most basic technical analysis concepts. if you already understand technical analysis, this article might just be a way to brush up on the basics or one to skip.\n\n# the foundation: supply and demand\n\nall technical analysis comes down to one thing: understanding supply and demand. if there are more buyers (demand) than sellers (supply), the price will move upwards. more demand than supply? the price will go up. much of technical analysis comes down to identifying where that supply and demand lies and making your investment based on that info.\n\ni find it a healthy exercise to reflect on the fact that, in every trade, there is one buyer and one seller: for any investment idea you have, there is someone on the other side thinking the exact opposite. and one of you will be wrong. it's a humbling concept, but one that will definitely make you think twice.\n\n# resistance/support\n\nwhen a cryptocurrency bounces off a certain price level twice, that could indicate a place of resistance or support. that is to say, there are a lot of people looking to trade at that price and the crypto will have a harder time breaking out above or falling below.\n\n**resistance**\n\nresistance is the tendency for an asset to approach a given price and fall back down just before or right after hitting it. it often happens at round numbers, because sellers concentrate supply around prices like $100 or $1000 or $60,000.\n\ncheck out the example below where bitcoin bounced off of its previous all-time high (resistance) before breaking through:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70dq5fwqxe181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=70b8e4a838dff4888a5b498628ab34e243465da0\n\n**support**\n\nonce a crypto breaks through a resistance price level, it often becomes support. support is a floor that an asset\u2019s price bounces off of. this can represent a good buying opportunity because frequently, after a crypto makes this critical test, momentum changes. many investors wait for that bounce to make a directional trade and buy at the lowest possible price.\n\nfor an example, check out the chart below for ethereum, where it broke through, then bounced off, the $3,000 price level for a few weeks.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mckp0bqye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c14b7fb13fe3e4a08f07caa0fcd5665f36379fae\n\ni like this tweet from three arrows capital investor su zhu on trading support and resistance:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pcprznqye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=32dbed2313af2423a6b6fa0afa384e52493c96ec\n\n# channels\n\nchannels are just what they sound like, two walls of prices that an asset is range-bound within. it's a combination of resistance and support\n\nchannels can trend up, down, or sideways. when channels trend sideways, it\u2019s often seen as an opportunity to accumulate a crypto.\n\nwhen these channels exist, there are a few possibilities for making money:\n\n* make a trade at the bottom hoping for a bounce\n* make a trade at the top hoping for a rejection\n* make a directional trade after a breakout\n\nhere's an example of what it looks like with dag crypto [coti](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coti)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1375zlhrye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cefadf6e443e4bbed51a9c3d464444316ea9d3\n\n# breakouts\n\na breakout happens when a crypto moves above a support area or below a resistance area. when identified correctly, this tends to be accompanied by a big move, either up or down, and thus a big opportunity. it happens a lot when a crypto hits, and then passes, an all-time high.\n\nbelow is a chart of bitcoin last year where it encountered resistance at its 2017 ath, then broke out with a big move to the upside:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnlao5wvye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=21af7e918d2375b1a14ecc7edd8558205fa7584b\n\n# moving averages\n\nlike price levels of support and resistance, moving averages are often areas of resistance and support as well.\n\n**simple moving average**\n\nthe concept of a simple moving average is, well, actually a little complicated: it is the \u201carithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation.\u201d it's basically the average price over the last period of time, plotted on a continuous line.\n\nthese moving averages end up being bands of prices that sit below the asset price in bullish times and above the asset price in bearish times.\n\nif you\u2019ve ever heard the term \u2018death cross\u2019 or \u2018golden cross,\u2019 it comes from moving averages. golden crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the upside, and often signals a pump in price. death crosses are when a short-term moving average crosses a long-term moving average to the downside.\n\nyou can see the chart below as an example of what moving averages look like on a chart as well as what it looks like when they cross.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d59hfemxye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d24e397a3c63a466ddb7bf32f4a3401837c6bb\n\n**exponential moving average**\n\nthe ema is similar to the sma, although it places more weight on recent prices. it\u2019s used in a similar way, to find buy and sell signals when it serves as resistance or support or when it crosses another moving average.\n\n# volume\n\nyou know those little bars at the bottom of a price chart, below the graph? those bars reflect volume--the amount of a given cryptocurrency, in dollars, traded over a time period.\n\nvolume can help us detect momentum\u2014a word used when a trend in a cryptocurrency is accompanied by large volume.\n\nincreased volume signals that whatever trend you're seeing is important. with more volume, we can see that more and more participants are pricing in new information, and that more participants are entering or exiting the market for that asset.\n\na price drop on very low volume probably isn\u2019t a huge reason to be concerned. a price drop on enormous volume means there\u2019s something big happening. see the may ethereum selloff for a good example of how high volume signaled a short bear market:\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brz2lawyye181.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=753599c45bc014f78715ca452a14215ff39f2c90\n\n# rsi\n\nrsi is a stat that ranges between 1 and 100 and attempts to show momentum. the calculation is a bit rough, but the basic idea is that if rsi is above 70, the crypto is overbought and might be due for a trend reversal. below 30 and it could be undervalued, ready to pull out of a downward slide.\n\nit's a bit more nuanced and must be used in conjunction with price data to be well understood. the fact that cryptos can remain 'overbought' or 'undervalued' for long periods of time makes it even more difficult to get right.\n\n&#x200b;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6f6qdoyzye181.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f8714a591c6213daa4679c92e75c4ddf0e1948\n\n**platforms for technical analysis**\n\nfor charting, tradingview is definitely the most popular service and it\u2019s free, although it\u2019s got a premium subscription available. the charts in this article all came from tradingview. coinigy and cryptowat.ch are also well-known services. i'd recommend tradingview just because it's so widely used.\n\n**the limitations (and infinite possibilities) of technical analysis**\n\ntechnical analysis is a tree that branches out in endless directions. on-chain analysts (market observers that look at public blockchain data) combine ta with other metrics. they combine these new metrics to make even more metrics derived from the first layer of ta statistics. it can make your head spin.\n\nthere are so many signals and patterns to identify that it often becomes difficult to find the patterns that are really important. as with everything, it comes down to practice, experience, introspection, research, and learning.\n\nit\u2019s really, really difficult to become a trader on solely technical analysis. when your money is on the line, it\u2019s easy to get emotional or overinvested in a narrative. an altcoin that\u2019s pumping is really hard to sell and will look like it can go forever. stories can be constructed in your own head.\n\ni think ta is best used in combination with other skills: position sizing, fundamental analysis, diversification, profit taking. it's another way to improve your arsenal as an investor, not a golden bullet.\n\ngood luck out there!", {"entities": [[4485, 4492, "crypto"], [6611, 6618, "crypto"]]}], ["dogira ($dogira)\n\nwebsite: https://dogira.net

the pretense that craig wright is satoshi nakamoto.** \n\nthe plaintiffs are alleging that wright stole bitcoins and ip from his deceased partner dave. the defendant is alleging that there was no

satoshi\u2019s keys publicly ([although did sign privately](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and his\u00a0[close associate calvin ayre tweeted that craig wright would provide satoshi keys after
